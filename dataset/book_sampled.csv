You Gotta Have Wa: When Two Cultures Collide on the Baseball Diamond,"From the author of Tokyo Junkie, “the definitive book on Japanese baseball and one of the best-written sports books ever” (San Francisco Chronicle). One might expect the sport of baseball in Japan to be a culture clash—a collision of American individualism with the Japanese focus on wa, or harmony. Instead, it has turned into a winning symbiosis. Imported American sluggers—some past their primes—have found new life in the East and have given credibility to the Japanese game. A succession of Japanese stars like Hideo Nomo left their teams to find success in the US major leagues, enabling MLB International to make hundreds of millions of dollars selling TV and licensing rights to its games in Japan. While philosophical differences remain, You Gotta Have Wa guides you through the strange and fascinating world of besuboru, or baseball. With a history of the game in Japan and an overview of the Japanese leagues and their rules, this book follows the careers of players and managers who influenced the game in the East and vice versa—including Babe Ruth, Ichiro Suzuki, Bobby Valentine, and Sadaharu Oh, the Japanese homerun king. Whether you are a Yankees or a Red Sox fan, a sports or an enthusiast of Japanese culture, “simply sit back and enjoy the wonderful stories in You Gotta Have Wa, one of the most unusual baseball books of the season” (The New York Times). “A wonderfully entertaining look at baseball and wa.” —Time “A terrific, fast-paced account of Japanese baseball.” —Chicago Tribune “A funny look at baseball in Japan that is as much a work of cultural anthropology as a sports book.” —Playboy",Robert Whiting,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=k7VYEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=k7VYEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=You+Gotta+Have+Wa:+When+Two+Cultures+Collide+on+the+Baseball+Diamond&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Open Road Media,2022,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=k7VYEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,Sports & Recreation,5.0

Hunting Mister Heartbreak: A Discovery of America,"A New York Times Notable Book ""In an era of jet tourism, [Jonathan Raban] remains a traveler-adventurer in the tradition of . . . Robert Louis Stevenson."" --The New York Times Book Review In 1782 an immigrant with the high-toned name J. Hector St. John de Crèvecoeur--""Heartbreak"" in English--wrote a pioneering account of one European's transformation into an American. Some two hundred years later Jonathan Raban, winner of the National Book Critics Circle Award, arrived in Crèvecoeur's wake to see how America has paid off for succeeding generations of newcomers. The result is an exhilarating, often deliciously funny book that is at once a travelogue, a social history, and a love letter to the United States. In the course of Hunting Mr. Heartbreak, Raban passes for homeless in New York and tries to pass for a good ol' boy in Alabama (which entails ""renting"" an elderly black lab). He sees the Protestant work ethic perfected by Korean immigrants in Seattle--one of whom celebrates her new home as ""So big! So green! So wide-wide-wide!""--and repudiated by the lowlife of Key West. And on every page of this peerlessly observant work, Raban makes us experience America with wonder, humor, and an unblinking eye for its contradictions. ""Raban delivers himself of some of the most memorable prose ever written about urban America."" --Henry Kisor, Chicago Sun-Times ""When Raban describes America and Americans, he is unfailingly witty and entertaining."" --Salman Rushdie",Jonathan Raban,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=LekI5dpfzuwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=LekI5dpfzuwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Hunting+Mister+Heartbreak:+A+Discovery+of+America&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Vintage,2011,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=LekI5dpfzuwC&source=gbs_api,Travel,4.0

The Reader over your Shoulder: A Handbook for Writers of English Prose,"In late October 1939, Robert Graves wrote to Alan Hodge: “I have begun a new book, about English.” Graves and Hodge had recently completed a social history of the between-wars period called The Long Week-End. Now they embarked on this new project, “a handbook for writers of English Prose,” to be called The Reader Over Your Shoulder. The world was in total upheaval. Graves had already fled Majorca three years earlier at the start of the Spanish Civil War. As they labored over their new writing project, Graves and Hodge witnessed the fall of France and the evacuation of Allied forces at Dunkirk. In early September 1940 began the bombing of London by the German Luftwaffe, a concentrated effort to destroy the resolve of the English people. Graves’s and Hodge’s idea was simple enough: at a time when their whole world was falling apart, the survival of English prose sentences, of writing that was clear, concise, intelligible, had become paramount if hope were going to survive the onslaught. They came up with forty-one principles for writing, the majority devoted to clarity, the remainder to grace of expression. They studied the prose of a wide range of noted authors and leaders, finding much room for improvement. Quoting grammarian and bestselling author Patricia T. O’Conner from her new introduction, “With a new war to be won, the kingdom couldn’t afford careless, sloppy English. Good communication was critical.” The book they would write would turn out to be one of the most erudite, and at the same time one of the most spontaneous and inspired, ever to take on the challenge of writing well. O’Conner in her introduction describes The Reader Over Your Shoulder as nothing less than “the best book on writing ever published.” The present edition restores, for the first time in three-quarters of a century, the original, 1943, text, which in subsequent printings and editions had been shortened by over 150 pages, including much of the heart of the book.","Robert Graves', 'Alan Hodge",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=iGFOEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=iGFOEAAAQBAJ&dq=The+Reader+over+your+Shoulder:+A+Handbook+for+Writers+of+English+Prose&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Seven Stories Press,2018,http://books.google.com/books?id=iGFOEAAAQBAJ&dq=The+Reader+over+your+Shoulder:+A+Handbook+for+Writers+of+English+Prose&hl=&source=gbs_api,Language Arts & Disciplines,2.0
Nuestra senora de la soledad (Spanish Edition),"The story of the missions is a compelling human drama that is a vital piece not only of California history, but also of American history.

This vital series is compatible with the mission-baed curriculum used in fourth-grade California classrooms.

Advanced Use Case Modeling: Software Systems (v. 1),"""This book isn't just another introduction to use cases. The authors have used their wealth of experience to produce an excellent and insightful collection of detailed examples, explanations, and advice on how to work with use cases."" –Maria Ericsson The toughest challenge in building a software system that meets the needs of your audience lies in clearly understanding the problems that the system must solve. Advanced Use Case Modeling presents a framework for discovering, identifying, and modeling the problem that the software system will ultimately solve. Software developers often employ use cases to specify what should be performed by the system they're constructing. Although use case-driven analysis, design, and testing of software systems has become increasingly popular, little has been written on the role of use cases in the complete software cycle. This book fills that need by describing how to create use case models for complex software development projects, using practical examples to explain conceptual information. The authors extend the work of software visionary Ivar Jacobson, using the Unified Modeling Language (UML) as the notation to describe the book's models. Aimed primarily at software professionals, Advanced Use Case Modeling also includes information that relates use case technique to business processes. This book presents a process for creating and maintaining use case models in a framework that can be fully customized for your organization. The authors, pioneers in the application of use cases in software development, bring their extensive experience to cover topics such as: A process model for applying a use case model How to keep your use case modeling effort on track Tips and pitfalls in use case modeling How to organize your use case model for large-system development Similarities between Advanced Use Case Modeling and the Rational Unified Process framework Effect of use cases on user interface design Guidelines for quality use case modeling","Frank Armour', 'Granville Miller",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=V5eER53NWJYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=V5eER53NWJYC&pg=PT53&dq=Advanced+Use+Case+Modeling:+Software+Systems+(v.+1)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Pearson Education,2000,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=V5eER53NWJYC&source=gbs_api,Computers,1.0

Redeye - A Western,"This New York Times Notable Book is a quirky tale of the Old West from the author of The Bible Salesman, “a master of comic timing” (Richmond Times-Dispatch). “A Hollywood pitchman might call Redeye Eudora Welty meets Mark Twain,” says the New York Times Book Review about Clyde Edgerton’s “small gem of a novel,” a witty adventure set on the nineteenth-century frontier. “A rollicking tale . . . The cliff dwellings of southwest Colorado attract a motley crew of explorers in 1892, each with a personal agenda. Abel Merriwether, a local rancher and amateur archaeologist, wants to explore and protect the site; Andrew Collier, an Englishman, wants to write about it; Billy Blankenship, a local businessman, wants to develop it for tourism; Bishop Thorpe, a Mormon saint, hopes to find proof that Jesus visited there 2000 years before; and Cobb Pittman, a drifter with a red-eyed dog, seeks revenge on Thorpe for the Mountain Meadows Massacre of 1875. How this diverse bunch converges for an ill-fated tour of the site is unforgettable. A master storyteller, Edgerton proves that he is in full command of his craft no matter what the setting.” —Library Journal",Clyde Edgerton,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=J4PuJTTSh44C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=J4PuJTTSh44C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Redeye+-+A+Western&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Algonquin Books,1995,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=J4PuJTTSh44C&source=gbs_api,Fiction,4.0
FIREFALL,"Firefall is the omnibus edition of the novels Blindsight and Echopraxia. February 13, 2082, First Contact. Sixty-two thousand objects of unknown origin plunge into Earth's atmosphere – a perfect grid of falling stars screaming across the radio spectrum as they burn. Not even ashes reach the ground. Three hundred and sixty degrees of global surveillance: something just took a snapshot. And then... nothing. But from deep space, whispers. Something out there talks – but not to us. Two ships, Theseus and the Crown of Thorns, are launched to discover the origin of Earth's visitation, one bound for the outer dark of the Kuiper Belt, the other for the heart of the Solar System. Their crews can barely be called human, what they will face certainly can't. 'A tour de force, redefining the First Contact story for good.' Charles Stross. 'If you only read one science fiction novel this year, make it this one!... It puts the whole of the rest of the genre in the shade...

The Existence and Attributes of God,"The Existence and Attributes of God comprises the first two volumes of the works of Stephen Charnock (1628-1680), an English puritan divine who was highly skilled in philosophy, patristics, Reformed theology, and Biblical languages. These volumes are his abiding monument. They are worthy of being compared with the finest in theology. ""When the existence and attributes of God are called into question, to whom else can we better go than to Stephen Charnock'' . . . ''those [things revealed belong to us and to our children forever]. The material that Charnock discusses is firmly founded in the Word of God'' . . . ''Both the Old Testament and the New emphasize these two things: First, we should study the whole revelation, not just some easy or favorite parts of it; secondly, the study of God's attributes is not dry as dust theology, but is practical; that is, it leads to righteousness"" (Dr. Gordon H. Clark, from a preface to this great work in a Sovereign Grace edition, 1958). One of the greatest tragedies in these spiritually starved times is the sad fact that most Christians know so very little about their God. It is often said that this is simply because these volumes are exhaustive on the subject. Yet it is clearly filled with sublime expositions of the truth regarding God's existence and attributes. ""Charnock displays God's attributes not as impersonal abstractions for the mind to juggle with, but as qualities observable in the concrete actions of the living God of which the Bible speaks. The technical terms and sometimes, arguments of scholastic theology are employed, but always with a Biblical orientation. Charnock has no desire to speculate, but only to declare the works and ways, the nature and character, of the God of the Bible. The substance of his doctrine is characteristically Puritan and representatively Reformed."" (Dr. James I. Packer, in The Encyclopedia of Christianity, Volume II, p. 410) The possessor of these rare volumes will be blessed by getting acquainted with the incomparable God, and thereby will reach a higher plane of spiritual enjoyment never attained before. To know Him better is to love Him more.",Stephen Charnock,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1HSYbKrVR8AC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=1HSYbKrVR8AC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Existence+and+Attributes+of+God&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,"Sovereign Grace Publishers,",2008,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1HSYbKrVR8AC&source=gbs_api,Religion,1.0
How to Go to Hell,"Today’s churches do not always touch on the subject of hell. God does not want anyone to go to hell, but if they do not put Him first in their life and do His works, one might not end up where they think they are going. Pastor Seung Woo Byun explores specific and powerful promises of God that point to heaven and hell. Readers are guided through biblical End-Time prophecies, with special focus on the impending rapture of the true church—the bride of Christ. Many questions are answered by an overview of the Rapture, the Second Resurrection, the Antichrist, the role of the Jewish people, and what one must do to be prepared. This “must-read” book will not only reveal where you do not want to go (and why), but where you do want to go and how to get there through Christ Jesus.

From Atlantis to the Sphinx,"In this compelling book, Colin Wilson argues that thousands of years before ancient Egypt and Greece held sway, there was a great civilization whose ships traveled the world from China to Antarctica. Their advanced knowledge of science, mathematics, and astronomy was passed on to descendants who escaped to Egypt and South America. From Atlantis to the Sphinx bases this assertion on a true fact: that archaeologists and geologists are at odds over the age of the Sphinx. Archaeologists claim that the Sphinx dates to classical dynastic Egypt, around 2,400 b.c. But some geologists claim that it could have been built as early as 7,000 to 10,500 b.c. The geologists' claim is based on the curious fact that the erosion of the Sphinx is more characteristic of water erosion than that of wind and sand. Starting from the assumption that there was an advanced civilization in existence much earlier than previously thought, Wilson goes on to claim that it could very well be Atlantis--not a literal island that sank, but more of a great civilization that either declined naturally or experienced a great catastrophe, passing on only a fraction of its knowledge to other peoples. From Atlantis to the Sphinx delves into what might have been a completely different knowledge system from that of modern man--one as alien to us as that of the Martians. The book sets out to reconstruct that ancient knowledge in a fascinating exploration of the remote depths of history, a ground-breaking attempt to understand how these long-forgotten peoples thought, felt, and communicated with the universe.",Colin Wilson,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=nHSJhcOmeSQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=nHSJhcOmeSQC&printsec=frontcover&dq=From+Atlantis+to+the+Sphinx&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Weiser Books,2004,http://books.google.com/books?id=nHSJhcOmeSQC&dq=From+Atlantis+to+the+Sphinx&hl=&source=gbs_api,History,5.0

Judgment & Justification In Early Judaism And The Apostle Paul,"New York Times bestselling author Joseph Finder returns with an explosive new thriller about a female judge and the one personal misstep that could lead to her--and her family's--downfall. It was nothing more than a one-night stand. Juliana Brody, a judge in the Superior Court of Massachusetts, is rumored to be in consideration for the federal circuit, maybe someday the highest court in the land. At a conference in a Chicago hotel, she meets a gentle, vulnerable man and has an unforgettable night with him--something she'd never done before. They part with an explicit understanding that this must never happen again. But back home in Boston, Juliana realizes that this was no random encounter. The man from Chicago proves to have an integral role in a case she's presiding over--a sex-discrimination case that's received national attention.

Winter Winds (Seaside Seasons #4),"In Winter Winds, Gayle Roper concludes her delightful Seaside Seasons series with a tale of romance, crime, startling mix-ups, and a few hard hearts that just might get a much-needed midwinter thaw. After his guardian's severe illness, pastor Paul Trevelyan returns to his congregation in Seaside with a big surprise - a wife he's been estranged from for seven years. It was the old man's ailing wish that Dori and Trev return to each other, and they agree, as long as they can sleep in separate bedrooms. The dangers of a sinister luggage mix-up are compounded by discord within the church, as a highly opinionated elder proves he will stop at nothing to see Trev gone. This blizzard of difficulties leaves just a snowball's chance of a thaw between the stubborn spouses. Bitter winds... After a tragedy-riddled early life, Dori MacAllister has made a quiet place for herself on the West Coast, far from the landscape of her earlier heartbreaks. When she receives word that the man who raised her is gravely ill, she is drawn back to a place full of love and longing—and betrayal. Winds of love... Pastor Paul Trevelyan hasn't seen the woman he loves in six years. When he's given a second chance with her, he longs to make it work this time. The trouble is, if he doesn't win her back, it could cost him his job—and his happiness. Winds of danger... The charming town of Seaside now has its very own crime boss, and Officer Maureen Galloway would love to be the one to make charges stick. her investigation leads to Dori MacAllister, but is Dori an accomplice or a victim?

This edition includes an all-new chapter updating the original with thoughts on the state of scouting in 2013.

And now, as big money has arrived to magnify the entire dynamic, Kerrane has returned to update his classic. ""They use 'inside baseball' as a term to suggest esoteric knowledge. That's ridiculous.

Life After Suicide,"From the chief medical correspondent of ABC News, an eloquent, heartbreaking, yet hopeful memoir of surviving the suicide of a loved one, examining this dangerous epidemic and offering first-hand knowledge and advice to help family and friends find peace. Jennifer Ashton, M.D., has witnessed firsthand the impact of a loved one’s suicide. When her ex-husband killed himself soon after their divorce, her world—and that of her children—was shattered. Though she held a very public position with one of the world’s largest media companies, she was hesitant to speak about the personal trauma that she and her family experienced following his death. A woman who addresses the public regularly on intimate health topics, she was uncertain of revealing her devastating loss—the most painful thing she’d ever experienced. But with the high-profile suicides of Kate Spade and Anthony Bourdain, Dr. Ashton recognized the importance of talking about her experience and the power of giving voice to her grief. She shared her story with her Good Morning America family on air—an honest, heartbreaking revelation that provided comfort and solace to others, like her and her family, who have been left behind. In Life After Suicide, she opens up completely for the first time, hoping that her experience and words can inspire those faced with the unthinkable to persevere. Part memoir and part comforting guide that incorporates the latest insights from researchers and health professionals, Life After Suicide is both a call to arms against this dangerous, devastating epidemic, and an affecting story of personal grief and loss. In addition, Dr. Ashton includes stories from others who have survived the death of a loved one by their own hand, showing how they survived the unthinkable and demonstrating the vital roles that conversation and community play in recovering from the suicide of a loved one. The end result is a raw and revealing exploration of a subject that’s been taboo for far too long, providing support, information, and comfort for those attempting to make sense of their loss and find a way to heal.","Jennifer Ashton, M.D.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ablnDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=ablnDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Life+After+Suicide&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,HarperCollins,2019,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ablnDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,Self-Help,1.0

The Facts of Life: and Other Dirty Jokes,"If you had to give America a voice, it’s been said more than once, that voice would be Willie Nelson’s. For more than fifty years, he’s taken the stuff of his life-the good and the bad-and made from it a body of work that has become a permanent part of our musical heritage and kept us company through the good and the bad of our own lives. Long before he became famous as a performer, Willie Nelson was known as a songwriter, keeping his young family afloat by writing songs-like “Crazy”-that other people turned into hits. So it’s fitting, and cause for celebration, that he has finally set down in his own words, a book that does justice to his great gifts as a storyteller. In The Facts of Life, Willie Nelson reflects on what has mattered to him in life and what hasn’t. He also tells some great dirty jokes. The result is a book as wise and hilarious as its author.

ANNIE BESANT: AN AUTOBIOGRAPHY (Adyar Deluxe Edition),"Nellie Dowell was a match factory girl in Victorian London who spent her early years consigned to orphanages and hospitals. Muriel Lester, the daughter of a wealthy shipbuilder, longed to be free of the burden of money and possessions. Together, these unlikely soulmates sought to remake the world according to their own utopian vision of Christ's teachings. The Match Girl and the Heiress paints an unforgettable portrait of their late-nineteenth-century girlhoods of wealth and want, and their daring twentieth-century experiments in ethical living in a world torn apart by war, imperialism, and industrial capitalism. In this captivating book, Seth Koven chronicles how each traveled the globe—Nellie as a spinster proletarian laborer, Muriel as a well-heeled tourist and revered Christian peacemaker, anticolonial activist, and humanitarian. Koven vividly describes how their lives crossed in the slums of East London, where they inaugurated a grassroots revolution that took the Sermon on the Mount as a guide to achieving economic and social justice for the dispossessed. Koven shows how they devoted themselves to Kingsley Hall—Gandhi’s London home in 1931 and Britain’s first ""people’s house"" founded on the Christian principles of social sharing, pacifism, and reconciliation—and sheds light on the intimacies and inequalities of their loving yet complicated relationship. The Match Girl and the Heiress probes the inner lives of these two extraordinary women against the panoramic backdrop of shop-floor labor politics, global capitalism, counterculture spirituality, and pacifist feminism to expose the wounds of poverty and neglect that Christian love could never heal.",Seth Koven,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=HW-YDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=HW-YDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA87&dq=ANNIE+BESANT:+AN+AUTOBIOGRAPHY+(Adyar+Deluxe+Edition)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Princeton University Press,2016,http://books.google.nl/books?id=HW-YDwAAQBAJ&dq=ANNIE+BESANT:+AN+AUTOBIOGRAPHY+(Adyar+Deluxe+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api,History,1.0
Eugenio: (Pope Pius XII) True Hero of the Holocaust,"“Focuses not just on . . . the pope’s response to the Holocaust, but on [his] life and papacy . . . as a whole . . . A refreshingly balanced approach” (Catholic Courier). Written by one of the foremost historians of Pius XII, this present biographical study—unlike the greater part of the vast and growing historiography of Pope Pius XII—is a balanced and nonreactive account of his life and times. Its focus is not on the pope’s silence during the Holocaust, though it does address the issue in a historical and objective framework. This is a biography of the man before and during his papacy. It probes the roots of his traditionalism and legalism, his approach to modernity and reformism in Church and society, and the influences behind his policies and actions. “This book adds a great deal to what we currently know about this most written about pope. The author introduces a number of principles which need to be discussed by experts and also by biographers of this pope, most importantly the concepts of papal impartiality and anti-Judaism as related to Pope Pius XII.” —Charles R.

To the precipice,"This urgent and eye-opening book makes the case that protecting humanity's future is the central challenge of our time. If all goes well, human history is just beginning. Our species could survive for billions of years - enough time to end disease, poverty, and injustice, and to flourish in ways unimaginable today. But this vast future is at risk. With the advent of nuclear weapons, humanity entered a new age, where we face existential catastrophes - those from which we could never come back. Since then, these dangers have only multiplied, from climate change to engineered pathogens and artificial intelligence. If we do not act fast to reach a place of safety, it will soon be too late. Drawing on over a decade of research, The Precipice explores the cutting-edge science behind the risks we face. It puts them in the context of the greater story of humanity: showing how ending these risks is among the most pressing moral issues of our time. And it points the way forward, to the actions and strategies that can safeguard humanity. An Oxford philosopher committed to putting ideas into action, Toby Ord has advised the US National Intelligence Council, the UK Prime Minister's Office, and the World Bank on the biggest questions facing humanity. In The Precipice, he offers a startling reassessment of human history, the future we are failing to protect, and the steps we must take to ensure that our generation is not the last.

The Stalin Front: A Novel of World War II (New York Review Books Classics),"1942, at the Eastern Front. Soldiers crouch in horrible holes in the ground, mingling with corpses. Tunneled beneath a radio mast, German soldiers await the order to blow themselves up. Russian tanks, struggling to break through enemy lines, bog down in a swamp, while a German runner, bearing messages from headquarters to the front, scrambles desperately from shelter to shelter as he tries to avoid getting caught in the action. Through it all, Russian artillery—the crude but devastatingly effective multiple rocket launcher known to the Germans as the Stalin Organ and to the Russians as Katyusha—rains death upon the struggling troops. Comparable to such masterpieces of war literature as Ernst Jünger's Storm of Steel and Erich Remarque's All Quiet on the Western Front, The Stalin Front is a harrowing, almost photographic, description of violence and devastation, one that brings home the unforgiving reality of total war.",Gert Ledig,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=IaMcAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=IaMcAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Stalin+Front:+A+Novel+of+World+War+II+(New+York+Review+Books+Classics)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,New York Review of Books,2014,http://books.google.com/books?id=IaMcAgAAQBAJ&dq=The+Stalin+Front:+A+Novel+of+World+War+II+(New+York+Review+Books+Classics)&hl=&source=gbs_api,Fiction,2.0

Operating Manual for Spaceship Earth,"Buckminster Fuller (1895–1983) was an architect, engineer, geometrician, cartographer, philosopher, futurist, inventor of the famous geodesic dome, and one of the most brilliant thinkers of his time. For more than five decades, he set forth his comprehensive perspective on the world’s problems in numerous essays, which offer an illuminating insight into the intellectual universe of this renaissance man. These texts remain surprisingly topical even today, decades after their initial publication. While Fuller wrote the works in the 1960’s and 1970’s, they could not be more timely: like desperately needed time-capsules of wisdom for the critical moment he foresaw, and in which we find ourselves. Long out of print, they are now being published again, together with commentary by Jaime Snyder, the grandson of Buckminster Fuller. Designed for a new generation of readers, Snyder prepared these editions with supplementary material providing background on the texts, factual updates, and interpretation of his visionary ideas. Initially published in 1969, and one of Fuller’s most popular works, Operating Manual for Spaceship Earth is a brilliant synthesis of his world view. In this very accessible volume, Fuller investigates the great challenges facing humanity, and the principles for avoiding extinction and “exercising our option to make it.” How will humanity survive? How does automation influence individualization? How can we utilize our resources more effectively to realize our potential to end poverty in this generation? He questions the concept of specialization, calls for a design revolution of innovation, and offers advice on how to guide “spaceship earth” toward a sustainable future. And it Came to Pass – Not to Stay brings together Buckminster Fuller’s lyrical and philosophical best, including seven “essays” in a form he called his “ventilated prose”, and as always addressing the current global crisis and his predictions for the future. These essays, including “How Little I Know”, “What I am Trying to Do“, “Soft Revolution”, and “Ethics”, put the task of ushering in a new era of humanity in the context of “always starting with the universe.” In rare form, Fuller elegantly weaves the personal, the playful, the simple, and the profound. Utopia or Oblivion is a provocative blueprint for the future. This comprehensive volume is composed of essays derived from the lectures he gave all over the world during the 1960’s. Fuller’s thesis is that humanity – for the first time in its history – has the opportunity to create a world where the needs of 100% of humanity are met. This is Fuller in his prime, relaying his urgent message for earthians’ critical moment and presenting pioneering solutions which reflect his commitment to the potential of innovative design to create technology that does “more with less” and thereby improves human lives . . . “This is what man tends to call utopia. It’s a fairly small word, but inadequate to describe the extraordinary new freedom of man in a new relationship to universe - the alternative of which is oblivion.” Buckminster Fuller.",R.

Murder in the Heartland,"For 16 years, Harry Spiller worked as a deputy sheriff, investigator, and sheriff in a place where murder isn't suppose to happen- Southern Illinois. Investigating murder cases mainly in Williamson County and assisting in other counties, he learned the hard reality that murder is all around us.

It doesn't matter if you live in a big city or a small county, with brick-front towns, small farms, white church houses, lakes and ponds, the Shawnee National Forest, and the muddy rivers. All too often, victims fall prey in places that we think are safe to raise our families, places where we take walks on hot summer nights, where our children play in the park without concern, where we fish in the local pond hoping to land the big one, and where we leave our doors unlocked at night.

THE CORMORANT.,"Christian Beamish, a former editor at The Surfers Journal, envisioned a low-tech, self-reliant exploration for surf along the coast of North America, using primarily clothes and instruments available to his ancestors, and the 18-foot boat he would build by hand in his garage.

Teach Yourself Romanian (Teach Yourself Tape),"The Danube is Europe's Amazon. It flows through more countries than any other river on Earth - from the Black Forest in Germany to Europe's farthest fringes, where it joins the Black Sea in Romania. Andrew Eames' journey along its length brings us face to face with the Continent's bloodiest history and its most pressing issues of race and identity. As he travels - by bicycle, horse, boat and on foot - Eames finds himself seeking a bed for the night with minor royalty, hitching a ride on a Serbian barge captained by a man called Attila and getting up close and personal with a bull in rural Romania. He meets would-be kings and walks with gypsies, and finally rows his way beyond the borders of Europe entirely...",Andrew Eames,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=iUqKafcKRukC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=iUqKafcKRukC&pg=PA326&dq=Teach+Yourself+Romanian+(Teach+Yourself+Tape)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Random House,2011,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=iUqKafcKRukC&source=gbs_api,Travel,3

Art Of The Rifle,"""Pick up a rifle and you change instantly from a subject to a citizen,"" says author Jeff Cooper. That is especially true now with fresh assaults on our freedoms and liberty from foreign and domestic sources. But before a rifle can be a tool of power, you must know how to use it well. Armed forces have almost abandoned the idea of serious riflecraft, and with the increasing urbanization of the world, fewer people grow up honing their rifle skills. It is time to set forth the art of the rifle before it becomes a thing of the past and something very important is lost forever. And what better person to do this than Jeff Cooper? He is America's foremost rifle instructor, the founder of Gunsite Ranch and the International Pistol Institute and the author of several classic books. In this special color edition, Jeff includes a new introduction and a new chapter on the Scout, as well as bringing you up to date on everything you need to know about the rifle, whether you intend to use it for securing meat, destroying enemies on the battlefield, protecting yourself and your family, shooting targets or resisting tyranny. He also entertains you with rousing tales of marksmanship, combat and big-game hunting all over the world. This is a book that you will treasure for years to come from America's most esteemed firearms master.",Jeff Cooper,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=WCMOAAAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=WCMOAAAACAAJ&dq=Art+Of+The+Rifle&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Paladin Press,2002,http://books.google.com/books?id=WCMOAAAACAAJ&dq=Art+Of+The+Rifle&hl=&source=gbs_api,Sports & Recreation,1

The Lesbian Reader,"In reading The Lesbian Polyamory Reader: Open Relationships, Non-Monogamy, and Casual Sex, you'll quickly discover that the steps toward love and happiness are as easy as 1, 2, 3, and maybe even 4 or 5. And you'll find that if your own lesbian relationship lies outside the traditional monogamous couple model, you're definitely not alone. You'll explore many multifaceted and multifarious love relationships, each one applicable to your own liking, if you so choose. You'll find successful models of relationship styles--regardless of your own orientation--from cover to cover, and you'll discover the pleasing polyphony in the many, many female voices of authorities on love and love relationships. Whereas other similar studies project the limited view of one or two authors, The Lesbian Polyamory Reader calls upon a broad scope of writers, professional women and academics alike. You'll see that outside the gay rights movement that currently pushes for a traditional, monogamous marriage model of gay couplehood, there lies pleasing multiplicity in the arms and hearts of lesbians worldwide. Specifically, this collection offers: first person articles--stories that describe a variety of lesbian experiences relating to multiple lovers in the 1970s, '80s, and '90s how-to articles--descriptions of the various polyamorous relationship configurations, including ways of dealing with jealousy theoretical pieces--the history of multiple relationships, the social implications of practicing a love style other than monogamous coupling, and safer sex considerations Much, much more than a book on personal satisfaction, The Lesbian Polyamory Reader also focuses on the social implications of this love phenomenon, bringing it into a more inclusive circle of discussion for lesbians, educators, and students of sociology and sexology. You'll find satisfaction in seeing the love so many lesbian women have achieved by not mimicking the marriage model of living.","Marcia Munson', 'Judith Stelboum",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=zWeOAQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=zWeOAQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Lesbian+Reader&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Routledge,2013,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=zWeOAQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,Family & Relationships,1
The Presence of the Past: Morphic Resonance and the Habits of Nature,"Rupert Sheldrake's theory of morphic resonance challenges the fundamental assumptions of modern science. A world-famous biologist, Sheldrake proposes that all self-organizing systems, from crystals to human societies, inherit a collective memory that influences their form and behaviour. Rather than being ruled by fixed laws, nature is essentially habitual. All human beings draw upon a collective human memory, and in turn contribute to it. Even individual memory depends on morphic resonance rather than on physical memory traces stored within the brain. Morphic resonance works through morphic fields, which organize the bodies of plants and animals, coordinate the activities of brains, and underlie mental activity. Minds are extended beyond brains both in space and time. This fully-revised and updated edition of The Presence of the Past summarizes the evidence for Dr Sheldrake's controversial theory, reviews new research, and explores its implications for biology, chemistry, physics, psychology and sociology. In place of the mechanistic worldview that has dominated biology since the nineteenth century, this book offers a revolutionary alternative, and opens up a new understanding of life, minds and evolution.",Rupert Sheldrake,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=SyeKFT9hPTUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=SyeKFT9hPTUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Presence+of+the+Past:+Morphic+Resonance+and+the+Habits+of+Nature&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Icon Books Ltd,2011,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=SyeKFT9hPTUC&source=gbs_api,Science,3

Practical Electronic Fault-Finding and Troubleshooting,Seasoned professional designers have that peculiar knowledge of their own work and specialized knowledge of its components to allow them to analyse and remove faults quickly on the spot (design errors take a little longer!). Fault finders can never have this depth of specialization: commercial pressures demand a minimum knowledge-to-do-the-job approach. Practical Electronic Fault Finding and Troubleshooting describes the fundamental principles of analogue and digital fault finding (although of course there is no such thing as a 'digital fault' - all faults are by nature analogue). This book is written entirely for a fault finder using only the basic fault-finding equipment: a digital multimeter and an oscilloscope. The treatment is non-mathematical (apart from Ohm's law) and all jargon is strictly avoided.,ROBIN PAIN,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=RvJK1wf41bUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=RvJK1wf41bUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Practical+Electronic+Fault-Finding+and+Troubleshooting&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Newnes,1996,http://books.google.com/books?id=RvJK1wf41bUC&dq=Practical+Electronic+Fault-Finding+and+Troubleshooting&hl=&source=gbs_api,Business & Economics,1
The New American House 2: Innovations in Residential Design and Construction: 30 Case Studies (Whitney Library of Design) (v. 2),"""Architect Tom Kundig is known worldwide for the originality of his work. This paperback edition of Tom Kundig: Houses, first published in 2006, collects five of his most prominent early residential projects, which remain touchstones for him today. In a new preface written for this edition, Kundig reflects on the influence that these designs continue to have on his current thinking. Each house, presented from conceptual sketches through meticulously realized details, is the product of a sustained and active collaborative process among designer, builder, and client. The work of the Seattle-based architect has been called both raw and refined--disparate characteristics that produce extraordinarily inventive designs inspired by both the industrial structures ubiquitous to his upbringing in the Pacific Northwest and the vibrant craft cultures that are fostered there."" --","Dung Ngo', 'Tom Kundig', 'Steven Holl', 'Rick Joy', 'Billie Tsien",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=nRbRm11U3wIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=nRbRm11U3wIC&pg=PA175&dq=The+New+American+House+2:+Innovations+in+Residential+Design+and+Construction:+30+Case+Studies+(Whitney+Library+of+Design)+(v.+2)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Princeton Architectural Press,2006,http://books.google.com/books?id=nRbRm11U3wIC&dq=The+New+American+House+2:+Innovations+in+Residential+Design+and+Construction:+30+Case+Studies+(Whitney+Library+of+Design)+(v.+2)&hl=&source=gbs_api,Architecture,1
The Century of Space Science (v. 1&2),"One of the most attractive features of the young discipline of Space Science is that many of the original pioneers and key players involved are still available to describe their field.

"Good Business: Leadership, Flow and the Making of Meaning","Since Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi published the groundbreaking Flow more than a decade ago, world leaders such as Tony Blair and former President Clinton, and influential sports figures like Super Bowl champion coach Jimmy Johnson have all been inspired by the book. In today's corporate upheaval, a new business paradigm is evolving. While many CEOs are being exposed for their greed, truly visionary leaders believe in a goal that benefits themselves as well as others. They realize that it is their vision and ""soul"" that attract loyal employees willing to go above and beyond the call of corporate duty. And their employees are realizing the same thing: while 80 percent of adults claim they'd work even if they didn't have to, the majority of them can hardly wait to leave their jobs and get home. Good Business starts with the premise that this is an age in which business and work have replaced religion and politics as central forces in contemporary life. The book reveals how business leaders, managers, and even employees can find their ""flow"" and contribute not only to their own happiness, but also to a just and evolving society. It identifies the factors crucial to the operation of a good business: trust, the commitment to fostering the personal growth of employees, and the dedication to creating a product that helps mankind. Good Business is sure to become a must-read text for anyone who values the positive contributions of individuals in the changing world of business.",Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=PkMEWBdln2MC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.nl/books?id=PkMEWBdln2MC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Good+Business:+Leadership,+Flow+and+the+Making+of+Meaning&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",Penguin,2004,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PkMEWBdln2MC&source=gbs_api,Business & Economics,2

Science and Culture: Popular and Philosophical Essays,"Hermann von Helmholtz was a leading figure of nineteenth-century European intellectual life, remarkable even among the many scientists of the period for the range and depth of his interests. A pioneer of physiology and physics, he was also deeply concerned with the implications of science for philosophy and culture. From the 1850s to the 1890s, Helmholtz delivered more than two dozen popular lectures, seeking to educate the public and to enlighten the leaders of European society and governments about the potential benefits of science and technology to a developing modern society. David Cahan has selected fifteen of these lectures, which reflect the wide range of topics of crucial importance to Helmholtz and his audiences. Among the subjects discussed are the origins of the planetary system, the relation of natural science to science in general, the aims and progress of the physical sciences, the problems of perception, and academic freedom in German universities. This collection also includes Helmholtz's fascinating lectures on the relation of optics to painting and the physiological causes of harmony in music, which provide insight into the relations between science and aesthetics. Science and Culture makes available again Helmholtz's eloquent arguments on the usefulness, benefits, and, intellectual pleasures of understanding the natural world. With Cahan's Introduction to set these essays in their broader context, this collection makes an important contribution to the philosophical and intellectual history of Europe at a time when science played an increasingly significant role in social, economic, and cultural life.",Hermann von Helmholtz,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xTxcgGX9dicC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=xTxcgGX9dicC&pg=PP1&dq=Science+and+Culture:+Popular+and+Philosophical+Essays&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,University of Chicago Press,1995,http://books.google.com/books?id=xTxcgGX9dicC&dq=Science+and+Culture:+Popular+and+Philosophical+Essays&hl=&source=gbs_api,Science,1

"The antiquities of Athens,","James ""Athenian"" Stuart and Nicholas Revett's monumental Antiquities of Athens was the first accurate survey of ancient Greek architecture ever completed. Based on precise measured drawings done at the sites of the ancient ruins between 1751 and 1754, these books set a new standard for archaeological investigation in the eighteenth century. In doing so, they also transformed our understanding of Greek architecture and by pointing up differences between Greek and Roman examples fundamentally challenged prevailing notions about a universal classical ideal and fueled the Greek Revival movement that dominated British, European, and American architecture and design for over a century. Originally published in four volumes that appeared between 1762 and 1816, Stuart and Revett's masterwork is presented here in its entirety as part of our Classic Reprint series and features a new introduction by scholar Frank Salmon. With its many images of buildings, plans, sculpture, friezes, and decorative objects such as vases, it remains the logical starting point for anyone interested in Athens, Greece, and its influence on the history of Western architecture.

"Sex, Death and Fly-fishing","Trout Bum is a fresh, contemporary look at fly fishing, and the way of life that grows out ofa passion for it. The people, the places, and the accoutrements that surround the sport make a fishing trip more than a set of tactics and techniques. John Gierach, a serious fisherman with a wry sense of humor, show us just how much more with his fishing stories and a unique look at the fly-fishing lifestyle. Trout Bum is really about why people fish as much as it is about how they fish, and it is ultimately about enduring values and about living in a harmony with our environment. Few books have had the impact on an entire generation that Trout Bum has had on the fly-fishing world. The wit, warmth, and the easy familiarity that John Gierach brings to us in Trout Bum is as fresh and engaging now was when it was first published twenty-five years ago.

' Vicki Mackenzie, author of the bestselling Why Buddhism Parenthood can be a time of great inner turmoil for a woman yet parenting books invariably focus on nurturing children rather than the mothers who struggle to raise them. This book is different. It is a book for mothers.

Ways that also allow space for the deeper reflections about who we are and what makes us happy.

This is Buddhism at its most accessible, applied to the daily realities of ordinary parents.

Samurai Fighting Arts: The Spirit and the Practice,"This book introduces the world of traditional Japanese martial arts and will provide readers with a deeper understanding of Bushido and Japan. Also known as Kobudo, these traditional martial arts can be seen as a continuation of samurai culture and comprise a number of styles formulated in the samurai era that are still being taught today. Aiming to develop Bujutsu (martial arts) and Heiho (strategy) to the highest possible degree, the samurai devised a code consisting of over eighteen arts. A samurai should have impeccable manners and be an expert in martial arts, but he should never be a killer. His swords contained his soul, which he cultivated by learning poetry and art, and by practicing Zen meditation. The author is the world-famous Kobudo grandmaster. He knows all the Kobudo styles, and his teaching of arts such as Iaijutsu and Jujitsu fascinates many students around the world. This is his first book in English, and it offers readers the opportunity to learn the lesser known arts of Kobudo,particularly the way of Nito Ryu-the two-swords method created by the famous samurai Miyamoto Musashi, and to understand the spirit behind it. Lavishly illustrated with around 700 photographs, Samurai Fighting Arts reveals many secret skills of Kobudo. It is divided into five chapters: Kobudo and its history; Kumiuchi Hyoho; Nito Ryu - the two-sword method; Iai and Kenpo; and Classical Kenjutsu and its application.",Fumon Tanaka,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=sBWasQSsb-UC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=sBWasQSsb-UC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Samurai+Fighting+Arts:+The+Spirit+and+the+Practice&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Kodansha International,2003,http://books.google.nl/books?id=sBWasQSsb-UC&dq=Samurai+Fighting+Arts:+The+Spirit+and+the+Practice&hl=&source=gbs_api,Sports & Recreation,2

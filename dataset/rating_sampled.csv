The Whole Foods Allergy Cookbook: Two Hundred Gourmet & Homestyle Recipes for the Food Allergic Family,Michelle M. Pagan,1,Waste of time and money,"This cookbook is a waste of money. The recipes are not for people with multiple food allergies and/or sensitivities, including some of the most common ones. Some of the ingredients are so out there. It is not practical. The recipes also require so many ingredients. It's ridiculous. Don't waste your money.",2023-01-01

A Taste of Haiti (Hippocrene Cookbook Library),M.

And ingredents are missing as well in some recipes. I would have to ask my grandmother for a second opinion about some of them to.I was really surprise of how the book look like when I got it...

Foundation PHP for Dreamweaver 8,"Al Qayoom ""Author of Implementing Excellence""",5,Excellent book to set up dynamic pages in Dreamweaver using php,"I am a frontpage user that has set up static pages in a web site. I needed to move from static pages to dynamic pages using a database. I couldn't use PHP with FrontPage so I switched to Dreamweaver and needed a book that covered both dynamic pages and Dreamwaver. This book walked me through setting up the environment to have Dreamweaver work with Apache, PHP, MySQL and phpMyAdmin. I am completely non-technical so these areas were beyond my comfort zone but the book walked me through it very successfully. It then took me through CSS styles, setting up an online feedback form, setting up my first database and tying it into Dreamweaver. It also showed how to insert, delete and maintain records in order to keep the database up to date. This was an excellent book for a non-techie as it didn't take any knowledge for granted.",2023-01-01

Making It on Broadway: Actors' Tales of Climbing to the Top,James LaMar,1,very disappointing,"As some of the other reviewers have said, it seemed like just a collection of complaints, rather than any positive information. I was looking for something that told the process of how one auditions, is chosen and begins the rehearsal process. (I have read this is other books, so that is what I was expecting.)And, the book is not really written, as much as simply a compilation of quotes.At first, I was thinking about donating it to my library. But, it was so depressing, I just threw it away.I do not recommend this book to anyone.",2023-01-01
The Whole Foods Allergy Cookbook: Two Hundred Gourmet & Homestyle Recipes for the Food Allergic Family,Ann,5,Whole Foods Allergy Cookbook,This book is great to use if you are working with allergies and wanting to learn how to eat and cook for others with allergies.

The Elements of C++ Style (Sigs Reference Library),Charles Ashbacher,4,"Small in size, large in content","This book is too small to be used as a physical weapon in the ""style wars."" Nevertheless, it is large in terms of content. Nearly all of the areas of style differences and disputes are covered. The authors do a good job in presenting their solutions to style difference problems without resorting to evangelical techniques. They express their opinions, justify them and then move on to the next style issue. Small segments of code, demonstrating both the right and wrong ways, are used to illustrate the point.The issues are placed into several groups:* General principles.* Formatting conventions.* Naming conventions.* Programming principles.* Programming conventions.* Packaging conventions.The 175 style issues are summarized into a set of short rules at the end of the book, which makes it easier to find specific elements.This book is not a bible, setting down the commandments for the proper style to be used in creating C++ code. It is a set of suggestions, and if you read it with that in mind, you will find this book of value.",2023-01-01
The Whole Foods Allergy Cookbook: Two Hundred Gourmet & Homestyle Recipes for the Food Allergic Family,Dee,1,Not so helpful...,I was dissapointed as the baking recipies all need egg replacer.

The recipes seemed good. Although it seemed she was torn between writing a kids cookbook vs. a ""Gourmet"" recipe cookbook. At age 6, many of the things in here my son would not try. But, I appreciated the snacks and cake recipes; and the sources for some of the ingredients. With an allergic child you are always conscious of trying to make sure they have a balanced diet. It would have been nice if the recipes had listed information on calories, protein, carbohydrate, etc.",2023-01-01
Writing the Laboratory Notebook (American Chemical Society Publication),Hongyi Wang,5,Tradition can save the reality,"This is one of the best titles from ACS. It may also be the only one detailing the laboratory notebooking to my best knowledge. It reveals that there is a lot more than ""write down what you do"" in this business.The current notebooking situation is not great in terms of graduates getting into industry. One thing to blame is the current academic systems' lack of education int this aspect. Much of the busniess was left to the advisor and/or graduate students. But... the good old tradition? Lost!A REAL and SERIOUS researcher in today's industrial world would benefit greatly from it. This is certaily clear to me in traditional chemical / pharmaceutical industry. The younger industry such as biotechnology has much to learn from the book too since quite a few simply neglect this critical issue. The legal departments ought to educate the employees and the management ought to enforce it. The reason simply is IP and patenting. The consequence simply is financial impact.The principles and spirit in the book work well in the past, today and almost certainly will into the future although there are some advancements such as internet and imaging technologies.",2023-01-01
Cooking at Home with The Culinary Institute of America,R. Fuller,5,Wonderful cookbook for any skill level,"I got this as a gift to myself and have made two recipes out of it so far. The first was the split pea soup, and the second was a lentil dish. The recipes are well thought out, well organized, and delicious. I would not say that what I have seen so far is anything overly challenging, which may be the reason I've pulled the book off the shelf twice this week after work! It provide loads of very approachable recipes incorporating a wide variety of ingredients, which is great because I have been wanting to try cooking more with ingredients that you don't find in traditional cookbooks, like Quinoa and bulger. All in all I am very, very happy with this book - I want to make EVERYTHING in it! As an added bonus, many of the recipes are healthy ones too! What more could you want in a cookbook?",2023-01-01

Foundation PHP for Dreamweaver 8,Dorothy Hesson,5,THIS is the Book I've Searched For,"After investing in books that were way too programmer-oriented, and books that assume that you only want to do one type of project, I was totally frustrated - and broke besides.Then I found Foundation PHP for Dreamweaver 8. This is by far the best book on the subject that I could have even dreamed of! It guides you through the process of installing some Apache, MySQL, PHP package for your own development server all the way to making some sophisticated dynamic pages.The directions are clear, the projects replicable in your own environment...

More importantly, this book provides a roadmap supported by rules and principles that will help an organization move closer towards their ideal state.

The Whole Foods Allergy Cookbook: Two Hundred Gourmet & Homestyle Recipes for the Food Allergic Family,"erin ""erin""",5,One of the best on my shelf,"I bought this book and several others when I decided to take better care of myself. My doctor suggested that I am developing new food allergies and this seemed to be one of the best books to buy. I was not disappointed.

The Whole Foods Allergy Cookbook: Two Hundred Gourmet & Homestyle Recipes for the Food Allergic Family,L. Finkelman,5,*The* best food allergy cookbook out there!,"This is one of my favorite cookbooks, food allergy or not. I *love* it! The recipes make us stop missing going to restaurants. I love The Lady from Naples sauce, 'My Favorite Salad Dressing', the soup with red pepper, the corn salad, potato salads, and most everything I have tried. My husband loves the Cherry Dijon Porkchops, meatballs and more. This is just a *great* cookbook. If you have a wheat allergy I think there may be some recipes you can't convert to being wheat-free so easily. However, the vast majority of the recipes do not call for wheat. Some of the products she recommended do have cross contamination issues. I recommend people call and verify whether a product is safe for yourself/your child in general. I appreciate the authors lists of foods and companies because I found some new, safe foods from them. And I greatly appreciate that eating is fun again in large part thanks to this wonderful cookbook. Thank you Cybele Pascal!",2023-01-01
The Whole Foods Allergy Cookbook: Two Hundred Gourmet & Homestyle Recipes for the Food Allergic Family,"Objective Book Review ""Fair and Balanced""",1,A Disgrace,"I would be hard pressed to call this book a food allergy cookbook. Rather it is a desperate attempt of a writer to publish a book in an exhausted, organic market. The author is clearly someone who promotes one's own self-interest at the expense of others by using and abusing those less fortunate. The author's tone throughout is at best, condescending. She condemns conventional ingredients and farming practices without an ounce of medical support for these ""theories."" For example:* In a strong plea to scare the consumer into buy free-range meats and poultry, the author has the audacity to suggest that meat processed in the U.S. via conventional methods may cause Mad-Cow disease (page 85). This is an outright lie.* Ironically, the author's philosophies on whole, organic produce and free-range meats are outdated. As published in a recent issue of the New York Post, ""Sustainably grown and locally produced organic food is expensive. Genetically modified, industrially produced monocultural corn is what feeds the victims of an African famine, not the gorgeous Technicolor Swiss Chard from your local farmers' market. Food for a small planet will, for the foreseeable future, require a much smaller human population on the planet.""* The only objective reviews on this site appear to be those that are less than 5-stars. However, these objective reviews are suspiciously smothered with vague, subjective 5-star reviews, some of which viciously attack the objective reviews. The author should be ashamed. To play upon the weaknesses of others to promote one's own self-interest is appalling and about as low as one can sink too. It only takes one bad apple to taint the humanitarian efforts of countless others in the quest to find a cure.",2023-01-01

The Hitchhiker's Guide to Lean: Lessons from the Road,Ryan Blanchette,5,A crucial roadmap,"Like many reviewers, I too have read many books on Lean, and have been unsuccessful at developing sustainable change in many organizations. The ""tool focused"" books are seductively inviting as they promise phenominal results with fairly easy steps. Like fad diets, the weight eventually comes back.I wish I had this book when I first started my Lean journey. Flinchbaugh and Carlino do a great job at defining the principles of lean, which is its true foundation. They go on to describe the process for transforming your organization through lean inclucation. They give you warning of the many common pitfalls along the way. And they demonstrate the ability to, and benefits from leveraging lean throughout the organization - not just in manufacturing.This book is a must for any organization attempting to be successful in their lean journey.",2023-01-01

I am an experienced web 'designer' (i.e. I can draw sites, I can make the (x)html and make the css) but I'd never really had the balls to get into the development side of things.This book was in PC World over xmas and I bought after reading the promising summary on the back. It truly does live upto it's own claims!David, the author, talks you how to set everything up as you need it, but still manages to give you options for the setup so you really feel like you're controlling your own environment before you even look at a script. The chapters (or 'Solutions') are fairly self contained and after reading the first few I'd updated my own site with plenty of dynamic content with ease.The later chapters that cover MySQL were what I was really wanting to get into and they didn't disappoint either, fantastic.I'd recommend this to anyone as it can be used as a tutorial book or just as a reference to have on hand. I know it's only a beginner's book but it really is worth the 20 quid.To top it off, the source files are absolutely brilliant AND David is a very active member of the FriendsOfEd forums so he'll kindly oblige any requests for help, usually within 24 hours.Super!",2023-01-01

The Whole Foods Allergy Cookbook: Two Hundred Gourmet & Homestyle Recipes for the Food Allergic Family,"whitecalx ""whitecalx""",3,It's a fine book if you can eat gluten,I actually picked this up from my library to look through before purchasing and I'm so glad that I did.Gluten allergy is so very common that I can't believe the author uses so many gluten containing flours in her recipes. Many of the recipes call for spelt but with a note to use barley flour if spelt is not tolerated. Both spelt and barley contain gluten. This book simply won't work for our family.,2023-01-01
Extreme Exploits: Advanced Defenses Against Hardcore Hacks (Hacking Exposed),"Stefan Fouant ""Technical Trainer, Juniper Net...",4,"Good coverage of darknets, honeynets, and triggered blackholes","First I must admit that I know and have worked with several of the authors of this book. I was given an autographed copy of the book late last year, however seeing as the book was published in 2005 I didn't think there would be much along the lines of useable information seeing as many of the security threats and vulnerabilities have evolved quite a bit since then. However, as I started reading the book I quickly realized much of the information was still relevant today as it was several years ago. The chapters on ISP Security Practices and Securing the Domain Name System had very good coverage of many of the techniques used throughout Service Provider networks to secure their network and DNS infrastructure.I particularly enjoyed reading the sections on using egress packet filters to restrict data leaks from within an organization - a particular problem today with the prevalance of Internet Worms and other Malware which often attempt to communicate back to their centralized Command & Control (C&C;) hosts. The chapter on 'Sinkholes and Backscatter' has very good coverage on a wide variety of topics such as using Darknets and Honeynets to monitor malicious traffic and other nasties emanating throughout your network, as well as using techniques such as Triggered Blackhole Routing to propagate filters quickly and dynamically to drop DDoS and other malevolent traffic.I would have to disagree with Dr. Anton Chuvakin that the chapters on Digital Forensics were disappointing. Personally, I learned quite a bit from these chapters and came away from reading them with a whole arsenal of new tools to use with which I can perform my own digital forensics on compromised systems. The coverage of Foremost, memdump, and some of the advanced digital forensic tools was top notch.All in all, I would say this is still a good book for anyone involved in Network Security. Much of the information covered is still relevant in today's networks. If the authors attempt to release a second edition I would suggest coverage of adapting Triggered Blackhole techniques to be used in more modern DDoS Mitigation scenarios. Additionally, discussion of new techniques used for Malware C&C; and coverage of Fast-flux and Double-flux techniques used by the attackers to create more robust and reliable networks would be welcomed.",2023-01-01

My son has multiple food allergies and the most challenge I have is baking with no gluten, eggs or dairy. This book avoids wheat, but uses barley flour, spelt flour instead, both of those contain gluten. Also, if you're looking for recipe to cook for your toddlers/young children with multiple food allergies, this may not be the book for you.

The Art of Focused Conversation: 100 Ways to Access Group Wisdom in the Workplace (ICA series),Joyce,5,Practical inspiration,"This book explores the use of a particular conversation format in the workplace, but it is adaptable to any group. If you are interested in community or involved in any groups, no process is more valuable than this one. This book tells the history of the creation of this method, explains its purpose and its parts, tells how to lead such a conversation, and offers 100 sample conversations for specific situations. The purpose of such a conversation is to allow a group of people to process their experience (to experience their experience, so to speak) by asking a series of questions in four different levels: the objective, the reflective, the interpretive and the decisional. This conversation gives form to a natural process which 1) grounds us first in the reality of life, 2) acknowledges the reality of our feelings, 3) looks at meaning based on the first two steps, not on some abstract idea, and 4) moves us into the future from the wisdom just discovered.

Fatal Harvest (Fatal Harvest Series #1),Harriet Klausner,4,will remind readers of Rachel Carson&#65533;s SILENT SPRING,"Though the Ivy League schools want Artesia High School, Texas student Matthew Strong to enroll, the computer guru is obsessed with finding a way to end world hunger. In his quest to turn Malthus on his head, Matt scrutinizes the files of Agrimax, one of the major international food suppliers where he finds abominable goings on at the expense of starving people. When a friend is killed, Matt flees to France desperately hoping to find an ally in the International Federation for Environmental and Economic Development (I-FEED).Matt's widower father rancher Cole had been distant from his son, but loves him deeply. He panics when Matt vanishes and turns to the only person he believes might have an inkling of where the lad is and what trouble he is in, his computer teacher Jill Pruitt. They hope to save Matt's life from those who want him silenced. Meanwhile, the teen meets Madam Losieau. Will she be the ticket for him to provide his data to the Chair of I-FEED located in the Sudan or is she a double agent ready to feed him to his enemies?FATAL HARVEST will remind readers (at least older ones) of Rachel Carson's environmental wake up call SILENT SPRING. The novel emphasizes making aware the plight of the world's hungry and exposing the avariciousnese of the mega agricultural conglomerates. The story line is extremely exciting in a David vs. Goliath manner with the sling shot and stones being a computer. Though the Madam Losieau link seems stretched, fans will appreciate this global bringing to light the international problem of world hunger packaged inside an action-packed thriller.Harriet Klausner",2023-01-01
Eclipse Cookbook,"Gary K. Evans ""Agile entrepreneur""",4,A great book of tips,"Holzner's ""Eclipse Cookbook"" is an excellent sequel to his earlier ""Eclipse"". The books not only differ in content, but are quite different in presentation. While ""Eclipse"" is a traditional narrative overview and introduction to the major features of the Eclipse IDE, the ""Cookbook"" is task-oriented, offering tips on subtle aspects of Eclipse not in the first book. For example, the first book does not mention code snippets, but the ""Cookbook"" offers specific information on how to run them to test just a portion of your code. The Code Assist feature is discussed in both books, but ""Cookbook"" has the more detailed explanation of how to customize this feature, and add your own code templates. For sheer information on using Eclipse, the ""Cookbook"" is great.Which should you buy? It depends. If you are not familiar with the features in Eclipse, the ""Eclipse"" book will be the right choice for you. If you have been using Eclipse for a while and know how to find the Preferences menu selection, and you have toyed with Code Assist, etc. but want some more detail on how to do specific things, then the ""Eclipse Cookbook"" is a better choice.The ""Cookbook"" is delightfully easy to read, and its 333 pages can be read in a couple sittings if you are a techie (and if you're not, why would you read a book on Eclipse details?) The only problematic chapters in ""Cookbook"" are the same as in Holzner's original ""Eclipse"": the chapters on SWT (Standard Widget Toolkit). He tries valiantly in three chapters to address Tips for SWT, and he generally does a great job. But SWT is not Swing or AWT. If you know SWT already these chapters will be much more helpful than if you don't. And if you don't know the event delegation model in Java, then these chapters will be pretty much a loss on you.The ""Cookbook"" is based on Eclipse 2.1, and all the screen shots are from 2.1. Holzner added to selected Tips a brief comment on changes in Eclipse 3.0 (which was officially released after the book publication). I did not find any glaring differences between the book and the actual Eclipse 3.0 product (www.eclipse.org). Some changes are evident in the layout of some menus and in Preferences, but nothing that will cause you to stumble.",2023-01-01

I finally found this gem and purchased it through Amazon. I tried fixing the griot (pork bits), pickliz, banan peze, and diri kole (rice and beans) first and it was a great success. Some of the ingredients may be hard to find, but we have a large hispanic community in our area and I went to one of their grocery stores and found most of what I needed. I had to substitute Jamaican hot peppers for Scotch Bonnet, but they're about the same. I had to go to another store for shallots. I adapted the griot a bit from the author's recipe and fried it rather than fixing it in the oven and next time I won't fry it quite as much. But I will vouch for the flavor as authentic. The rice and beans came out perfectly! I talked with my brother and he ordered a copy. My sister told me that if I fix the lambi (conche), she'll fly out from Chicago for it! Thanks for a great cookbook!",2023-01-01
The Whole Foods Allergy Cookbook: Two Hundred Gourmet & Homestyle Recipes for the Food Allergic Family,"Erin ""Super Mommy""",4,Terrific resource for nursing the soy/dairy allergic baby,"We don't have severe allergies, so I will not comment on how perfect this oookbook is for more serious or complex allergies. Although I think it's worth mentioning that the author does highlight different substitutions, depending on what you're allergic to, and recommends consulting your allergist if you're not sure.In our case, my 4 mo. old baby has a milk/soy allergy, and because of her other health issues, her nutritionist and I feel it is very important to continue breastfeeding instead of going to a hypoallergenic formula. I've been on the diet for 2 1/2 months now (my daughter's syptoms disappeared) and it wasn't until reading this book that I felt some real hope for a 'normal' diet. I've tried many of these recipes, none of them I found to be that difficult- and they were eaten and enjoyed by me, my husband and our toddler. Some may be a little fancy, but I found the ingredients from our local grocery store (in the organic aisle), and the rest from our local organic food co-op store.I realize everyone these days is about convenience food- and I admit that it's much easier to whip up a 20 minute meal when you return home from work. I guess I just enjoy cooking because the time involved doesn't bother me, so long as it tastes good. One recipe in the book- a recipe for a red sauce is a great example. You can find an allergen free organic pasta sauce pretty easily from the grocery store- so if you only have 15 minutes to make a pasta dish (and sometimes I fall in this category), than I would buy a jar of that instead of searching this cookbook for a pasta recipe. But if you like the process of making your own food- starting with tomatoes, blanching them, adding in your own fresh herbs- then the recipes in this cookbook would be great for you. My toddler 'helped' me make an entire Christmas dinner from this cookbook and then we all enjoyed eating it. Hands down, our fav recipe is the sausage/dried fruit stuffing. I like the philosophy and idea of trying to eat whole foods, and that meals should be savored and enjoyed- while preparing and while eating :) Happy cooking!",2023-01-01

The Whole Foods Allergy Cookbook: Two Hundred Gourmet & Homestyle Recipes for the Food Allergic Family,Jessica Carr,5,My new FAVORITE COOKBOOK!,"I recently found out I have numerous food allergies and sensitivities - this cookbook is definitely my new favorite! Not only are there TONS of delicious REAL FOOD recipes - they don't seem to be super complicated or time consuming! Best of all - most if not all recipes use natural sweeteners as opposed to refined sugars. HIGHLY recommend! There are several recipes that include corn or cornmeal though so, if corn is one of your allergens there are several of those in there and several use spelt or barley flour - so if you are gluten intolerant you may have to do some substitutions.",2023-01-01
Foundation PHP for Dreamweaver 8,Jeannette Bournival,1,"Good Presentation, Poor Kindle Graphics","The book is well written and exactly what I wanted on PHP and Dreamweaver 8, but the figures and code graphics are impossible to read on the Kindle. I requested a refund and was promptly granted it. I have ordered the paperback edition. Interesting to note that I paid $31.99 for the Kindle version about a month ago and the price is now $23.75. The paperback price is just under $3.00 more than the Kindle price.",2023-01-01

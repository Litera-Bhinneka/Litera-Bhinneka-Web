Programming Jabber: Extending XML Messaging (O'Reilly XML),Julian Missig,5,DJ delivers an excellent primer into the world of Jabber,"As a disclaimer, I have been involved with Jabber for 3 years, am the author of one of the more popular Jabber clients for linux, and am a friend of DJ's.Jabber finally has its Bible. DJ has written an excellent introduction into the world of Jabber, covering everything a programmer would need to become familiar with the protocol for this Open instant messaging system. He covers everything from the basics of what exactly Jabber is, how to deal with presence, messages, and basic extensions, all the way up to complicated and unfinished extensions such as XML-RPC. Anyone programming Jabber needs this as a reference, and anyone looking to get started in the Jabber world need not look further than this book.",2023-01-01
Lochs & Glens of Scotland,"J. Simpson ""sfraziera""",4,A Close Look at the Land of Scotland - but no maps,"Excelent Photography and text presenting Scotland's back country. This book reviews Scotland by area. It is almost a travel log -- but is not -- in that it looks at sections of Scotland area by area with appropriate landscape photography as well as pictures of special features (buildings, monuments, water falls, ruins, and even trees).The one major problem with this book is that there are no maps. My wife was very frustrated reading the book because she could not figure out where some of the places were, and our maps did not list the locations being described.",2023-01-01
Pasquale's Nose: Idle Days in an Italian Town,Tuscanwino,5,The place is for real...,"Having read and greatly enjoyed this story, I later found myself at Sutri enroute from Rome to Tuscany. My wife and I stopped to stretch our legs and see the town. It is as described, and so are the people. When Michael's name and/or book were mentioned, most people rolled their eyes (lovingly). This book made a visit to Sutri infinitely more enjoyable, and made it a special place among places on the Via Cassia (SS2).",2023-01-01

French Made Simple: Learn to speak and understand French quickly and easily,Shanda Needham,3,Not so simple,"This book is informative, but I think the title is misleading. I'm finding I have to study it and look for answers, and use an online pronunciation guide. I have a good idea I'm pronouncing words right, but I am not sure. And I do find out some things in later chapters about spelling, grammar, and pronounciation, that would have been helpful to know earlier. I agree with their ""learn to understand French"" description of the book more than their ""learn to speak French quickly and easily"" description. I think at this point in time (I'm on chapter 7 out of 40) it will take me a long time to know French enough to speak it well. If not for the little bit of French schooling that I had from elementary and middle school years ago, I don't think I would be doing well with this book. Not for the beginner, in my opinion.",2023-01-01
French Made Simple: Learn to speak and understand French quickly and easily,Ed Flaspoehler,5,"Thorough, but not for total beginners.","I used this book for my review of French in preparation for a recent trip to Paris. I found it very well organized and thorough.I took it to work with me each day on the train and was able to review a dialogue and chapter in a day or so over the course of about three months. It was very up to date, and covered the material logically and clearly. And the dialogues were consistently interesting and entertaining.However, in spite of what the cover says, this is not a book for total beginners. I was fortunate that I already had a firm foundation in pronunciation, vocabulary and basic French grammar. But this book dives in quickly, and beginners would probably not find it so easy and should probably look elsewhere.However, if you have already studied French in high school or college, and a quick review of the basics is what you are looking for, I am sure that you will find this book to be what you are looking for.What I need now is a good review of Italian, for my yet to be planned trip to Rome and tour of Italy!",2023-01-01

Economics and the Theory of Games,X,5,My favorite game theory book,"I am a PhD student at Cornell studying game theory, and this is by far my favorite non-cooperative game theory book. It's written at a similar level as Fudenberg and Tirole's book but with better examples, explanations, and organization. These strengths make it a very good book to learn advanced game theory. Additionally, it covers popular recent topics such as evolutionary game theory and networks in more detail than in other advanced books (F&T;, Osborne & Rubinstein, Myerson, etc.).With that said, it is not an easy book, requiring strong math skills, etc. If you are looking for a simple introduction, check out the books by Gibbon or Gintis.",2023-01-01

Pasquale's Nose: Idle Days in an Italian Town,"countsheep ""Sleepy""",4,"Italy, or anywhere, at its best and most real.","People are complex and messy, I think, at least when they're truly being themselves. What I liked about this book was that it seemed to show a town where the locals are very comfortable being themselves, with their full ""eccentricity"" on display (though I suspect the true eccentricity is manifest in the desire of so many human beings to present some kind of uniformly ""sane"" facade).Some of the reviews that were less happy with this book seem to object to its disjointed feel, its lack of a clear story line. If that's what you're looking for, you may very well be disappointed. BUT, if you're willing to look at it as essays or character sketches, with a little bit of musing about why the Sutrini are the way they are (and really, why *we* are the way we are), you may enjoy it more. The book feels a little uncomfortable at first, probably much the way I'd imagine Rips felt when he arrived and dove into this strange new world.I read the book after arriving back home in the states after 5 weeks in Italy. Were that not my particular circumstance, I think I might have found the book less believable. But then I remember my time there, and also remember my time living in small towns in the USA, and realize Rips is probably telling the truth--mostly (it's just that the Italians have had a longer time to build local lore and a longer history to draw from and feed their quirkiness). In general, in small town Italy (at least a number of them where I've traveled) many people seem to radiate a mostly enviable attitude of not really giving a hoot what anyone thinks of them.I found the inhabitants of Sutri as presented by Rips fascinating, frustrating, lovable, bizarre, and very human. I also enjoyed Rips' reflections as these people held up a mirror to him and he seemed to begin to embrace or at least be pulled into the strangeness of it all, as though this place gives one permission to do just that, to get in touch with one's inner eccentric.This is definitely NOT your typical know-it-all expatriate memoir or the typical romanticized fantasy of Italy (though I've enjoyed some of those, too). It's colorful and interesting, a nice combination of sociology, anthropology, history, philosophy and humor. All that, and it was a quick read, too.",2023-01-01
French Made Simple: Learn to speak and understand French quickly and easily,My Two Cents,5,User-friendly and inexpensive,"I purchased this book to supplement my audio learning of French using the Pimsleur method.

Programming Jabber: Extending XML Messaging (O'Reilly XML),"""cpfeifer""",4,This book covers all layers of Jabber very well,"When I first picked up this book, I expeted to understand the Jabber protocol in sufficient depth to implement my own IM client. Instead, the approach this book takes is that Jabber isn't just an XML-based protocol strictly for IM, rather it is a general purpose event notification protocol that has some very nice message routing and user management features built into it. While I was reading about the messages that Jabber has defined as part of the protocol, I could easily see other applications/devices generating Jabber messages to notify subscribers (either other systems, or people) of events.This book covers everything relevant to Jabber technology, from lowest level innerworkings and extensibility examples for developers to configuration and deployment for admins. Most of the book is spent looking directly at the Jabber XML protocol, instead of a specific API implementation. This way, the book covers the technology and doesn't get lost in how one particular API models the protocol.",2023-01-01

Artists in Residence: A Guide to the Homes and Studios of Eight 19th-Century Painters In and Around Paris Paperback with slip case,Beyond-Is-Within Also,5,"Gorgeous pic-survey and complete travel guide, NOT art crit!","I'll agree with the previous reviewer concerning this title's arty status, and then some -- this is the most delicious mini-coffee-table book/slipcase combo I've come across in years of book reselling. But the demand for heavyweight art-crit action is misdirected.The book's subtitle says ""A Guide,"" and that's exactly what it is, via glorious photos of interiors with atmospheric introductory texts; repros of a typical work or two; and shots of the surrounding countryside -- PLUS complete information concerning: how to get there and where to stay; walking tours of the areas and other local tours of interest; and where to eat nearby. It even has a bibliography -- quite a satisfying package in 143 pages!If you love French art and plan to be around Paris, just grab yourself a copy of this title, plan your pilgrimage, and GO -- then do the art-crit thing afterwards....",2023-01-01

However, what becomes so clear when one peruses the collection edited by David Cahan is that Helmholtz has much of interest to say to philosophers, artists, musicians, and historians. This collection includes his most important public addresses on a wide range of topics and provides a clear portrait of the breadth of Helmholtz's contributions to science and intellectual life. This provides in English what is lacking in the original German editions - a readily available, inexpensive edition of Helmholtz's highly influential work.",2023-01-01

Pasquale's Nose: Idle Days in an Italian Town,D. R. Ransdell,4,Life as a Tomato,"Rips paints a town of amazing, eccentric characters you long to get to know yourself. I found the words of the Philosopher of special interest. This Sutrian old-timer defines the tomato [and its concentrate] as being &quot;the perfect food for the traveler, who is, himself, in an indefinite or ambiguous state--separated from the place of departure but not yet attached to the place of arrival.&quot; When I read the above passage, I did a double-take. I was on a plane drinking tomato juice, which I never order at a restaurant nor drink at home! Rips' are the kinds of stories you only gather by 'going native,' living in a foreign place long enough to really know it. By sharing his stories, Rips takes us with him.",2023-01-01
Pasquale's Nose: Idle Days in an Italian Town,S. Isselhardt,2,Not Very Interesting,I could not get interested in this at all. Maybe 4-5 pages held my interest.

I love books about Italy and Tuscany in particular but this would be pretty low on my list.,2023-01-01
"Computer Architecture: Software Aspects, Coding, and Hardware","Bob_Bryan ""robertcbryan""",1,Disappointing: A good book done badly.,"If this were the only book in the world on the subject, I would probably recommend it. As it happens, there are lots of other books out there, almost all of which are better. I picked up this book because I always enjoy reading how computer architecture is covered and it seemed to contain some subjects of particular interest. I promptly discovered that while it contains a lot of good material, it is incredibly poorly organized, badly edited and actually contains factual errors.Parts of it remind me of a professor I had in college that covered material he had read about but have never actually worked with. I am kind of surprised to see material presented this way in such a nice looking textbook from a respectable publisher.What is particularly frustrating is that there is a lot of good material here. If it were massively edited with some major rewriting (with fact checking), it could be turned into quite a good book. Until that happens, I would suggest avoiding this particular volume.",2023-01-01
French Made Simple: Learn to speak and understand French quickly and easily,"B. Keilani ""Journeyman""",4,Very useful for building up your reading skills,"Personally, I think that reading is very useful for building your fluency, and reading definitely helps you with your listening skills. The author, it seems, wants you to read the texts several times including silently and out-loud. If you go over these texts more than once, it would definitely help you improve your French skills in various areas. I really enjoy reading this. I've studied French for years, and I can still say there are some gaps in my learning. This is not only good for reviewing, but also for people trying to hone their skills. It might be slightly difficult for an absolute beginner as some have said, but if you can find a native speaker to insist you, it could go a long way or come back to this book after using some books that help you build up your skills and vocabulary. If you've finished say 2 semesters of French, this shouldn't be hard to handle at all. An absolute beginner whose absolutely determined and diligent and persistent could benefit from this book on the first go. As far as the pronunciation, it's hard to get that simply from how the author writes it.I can't necessarily agree with how states that the French ""a"" sounds like the ""a"" in cat in English. I don't think so.Otherwise, he does a great job. Maybe if you're from England, that pronunciation of cat might work or some parts of New England.I bought this book used, and I'm happy that I bought it. I will read the texts more than once. I can see they're very useful and can help you improve your reading skills without much stress at all. Some readers could be stressful for some learners. While this isn't really a reader, it can function as one!:)",2023-01-01
Pasquale's Nose: Idle Days in an Italian Town,tom,5,Good to the last drop of espresso ...,"As one of the many who has fallen in lust with Italy over a too-short visit, I found this a fun read.The author displays a whacked-out sense of humor as he deconstructs the citizenry of a small town (large village?) north of Rome.

Pasquale's Nose: Idle Days in an Italian Town,"Leonard J. Waks ""philosopher and armchair tra...",5,Zen Italy,"Michael Rips described himself as a lost soul who has no useful skills and can find no direction in life. This is the author, lawyer and writer Michael Rips, speaking about a character, ""Michael Rips,"" who bears no more relation to the author than the character ""Woody Allen"" bears to the famous film actor and director.I was pleased to learn in another review that the town of Sutri actually exists. Although that other reviewer states that this town is perfectly described by Rips, I had my doubts whether there was such a town, or, if there were, it bore about the same relation to Rips ""Sutri"" that Rips the author bore to his character. In any event, it would not matter, because despite the local color it lends to the book, the place is not in itself of great importance. Quirky people can be found making a life together everywhere, and that is what this book is ultimately about.The book consists of short chapters composed of shorter vignettes. The first chapter establishes the character ""Rips"", the setting ""Sutri"", and the situation that brings Rips and his wife to that town: the author's inability to do anything useful. The character then hangs out in cafes and tries without much success to engage the locals and understand them.Unlike the authors of Italian Neighbors (Tim Parks) and A Small Place in Italy (Eric Newby), Rips never succeeds in penetrating the town, and his character descriptions of the locals are mere anecdotes describing their incredible eccentircities. As one friend expresses it, the Sutrini are ""mad, mad"".But about halfway through the book, this premise sufficiently established, Rips stretches out. The eccentricities are replaced by genuine paradoxes, and each anecdote becomes something of a zen koan. Reflections on these may be highly amusing, but will not yeild to rational understanding.By the end of the book a convincing world of paradox, a zen world, is established. In creating their town, the Sutrini have relied on collective myths (many not merely mythic but demonstrably false) which over time have affected the being of each of the residents as they strive to fit in and make sense of their lives. In this way the town is more than the sum of its parts, and each resident is less an ""individual"" than a living ""particle"" in this larger whole. It is impossible to live in this world as a rational autonomous ""individual"" or to understand the Sutrini one by one as individuals.Thus the portrait of the town comes to its own sort of wholeness and completeness, not merely despite the absence of penetrating character studies of the locals, but because of it.",2023-01-01

Leading Change: Why Transformation Efforts Fail (HBR Classic) (HBR OnPoint Enhanced Edition),"Donald Mitchell ""Jesus Loves You!""",5,Make Change Irresistibly Attractive,"The leaders of some organizations have no idea how to make successful changes, and are likely to waste a lot of resources on unsuccessful efforts. Professor Kotter has done a solid job of outlining the elements that must be addressed, so now your organization will at last know what they should be working on.On the other hand, if you have not seen this done successfully before, you may need more detailed examples than this book provides or outside facilitators to help you until you have enough experience to go solo. I suspect this book will not be detailed enough by itself to get you where you want to go.Here's a hint: The Harvard Business Review article by Professor Kotter covers the same material in a much shorter form. You can save time and money by checking this out first before buying the book.I personally find that measurements are very helpful to create self-stimulation to change, and this book does not pay enough attention in that direction. If you agree that measurements are a useful way to stimulate change, be sure to read The Balanced Scorecard, as well, which will help you understand how to use appropriate measurements to make more successful changes.If you want to know what changes to make, this book will also not do it for you. I suggest you read Peter Drucker's Management Challenges for the 21st Century and Peter Senge's Fifth Discipline.Good luck!",2023-01-01

Science and Culture: Popular and Philosophical Essays,Viktor Blasjo,5,Some highlights,"Against Euclidean transcendental intuition. The mind invents the categories in terms of which it perceives the world. ""The same aether vibrations which the eye feels as light, the skin feels as heat. The same aerial vibrations which the skin feels as whirring motions, the ear feels as sound."" (p. 346). ""Kant, however, went further ... [and] considered spatial determinations as little belonging to the real world, 'to the thing in itself,' as the colors which we see belonging to bodies in themselves, and which we rather brought into them through out eyes."" (p. 348). Be here there is a strong disanalogy: spatial intuition, according to Kant, contains definite content, namely the Euclidean axioms. The supposed proof of this is that we can all intuit Euclidean geometry and no other geometries. But this proof fails. By the same reasoning one could ""prove"" that the English language is innate while Swahili is not. Just as we are born with a general language capacity that quickly specialises in response to given environmental conditions, there is every reason to think that our spatial intuition is initially neutral with respect to Euclidean or non-Euclidean geometry and subsequently formed by empirical data. Thus Kant's claim that the Euclidean axioms are innate is: ""1. an unproven hypothesis; 2. an unnecessary hypothesis, since it pretends to explain nothing in our factual world of representation that could not also be explained without its help; and 3. a completely unusable hypothesis for the explanation of our knowledge of the real world, since the theorems established by it may first be applied to the relations of the real world after its objective validity has been experimentally proven and determined"" (p. 380). Point 3 may be illustrated by the following example (p. 373). Let ABC be an equilateral triangle. Extend AB and AC above A and mark the points b and c on these lines that have the same distance to A as do B and C. Now: does bc=BC? Euclidean geometry says yes; non-Eucliden no. It is not for the mind to decide the outcome: the mind invents the categories in terms of which it perceives the world, but equality or inequality of impressions must depend on equality or inequality in the underlying physical reality, whatever it may be.""On Academic Freedom in German Universities."" ""Such was the origin of Universities"": ""a free confederation of independent men, in which teachers as well as taught were brought together by no other interest than that of love of science; some by the desire of discovering the treasure of mental culture which antiquity had bequeathed, others endeavouring to kindle in a new generation the ideal enthusiasm which had animated their lives"" (p. 330). Today ""the German student alone has this perfect joy."" ""He can devote himself to the task of striving after the best and noblest which the human race has hitherto been able to attain in knowledge and in speculation, closely joined in friendly rivalry with a large body of associates of similar aspirations, and in daily mental intercourse with teachers from whom he learns something of the workings of the thought of independent minds."" (p. 334). ""You, my younger friends, have received in this freedom of the German students a costly and valuable inheritance of preceding generations. Keep it---and hand it on to coming races, purified and ennobled if possible. ... But freedom necessarily implies responsibility. It is as injurious a present for the weak, as it is valuable for strong characters. Do not wonder if parent and statesmen sometimes urge that a more rigid system of supervision and control, like that of the English, shall be introduced even among us. There is no doubt that, by such a system, many a one would have been saved who is ruined by freedom. But the State and the Nation is best served by those who can bear freedom, and have shown that they know how to work and struggle, from their own force and insight and from their own interest in science."" (pp. 334-335). ""Another point in which German Universities are distinguished from the English and French ones ... is that we start with the object of having instruction given, if possible, only by teachers who have proved their own power of advancing science. ... The English and French ... lay more weight ... on what is called the 'talent for teaching'---that is, the power of explaining the subjects of instruction in a well-arranged and clear manner, and, if possible, with eloquence, and so as to entertain and fix the attention. ... I am by no means prepared to defend what is, frequently, our too great contempt for form is speech and in writing. It cannot ... be doubted that many original men, who have done considerable scientific work, have often an uncouth, heavy, and hesitating delivery. Yet I have not infrequently seen that such teachers had crowded lecture-rooms, while empty-headed orators excited astonishment in the first lecture, fatigue in the second, and were deserted in the third. Anyone who desires to give his hearers a perfect conviction of the truth of his principles must, first of all, know from his own experience how conviction is acquired and how not. ... A teacher who retails convictions which are foreign to him, is sufficient for those pupils who depend upon authority as the source of their knowledge, but not for such as require bases for their convictions ... [Thus] The free conviction of the student can only be acquired when freedom of expression is guaranteed to the teacher's own conviction---the liberty of teaching."" (pp. 335-336).""The Relation of Optics to Painting."" Small particles in the air scatter light. ""The colour of the light reflected by the opaque particles mainly depends on their magnitude. When a block of wood floats on water, and by a succession of falling drops we produce small wave-rings near it, these are repelled by the floating wood as if it were a solid wall. But in the long waves of the sea, a block of wood would be rocked about without the waves being thereby materially disturbed in their progress."" Since blue light has the shortest wavelength it is most easily scattered. That is why the sky is blue: while the red and yellow rays pierced through the atmosphere, the blue ones were deflected down to us. ""Conversely, the denser turbidity consists mainly of coarser particles, and is therefore whitish. As a rule, this is the case in the lower layers of air, and in states of weather in which the aqueous vapour in the air is near its point of condensation. On the other hand, the light which reaches the eye of the observer after having passed through a long layer of air, has been robbed of part of its violet and blue by scattered reflections; it therefore appears yellowish to reddish-yellow or red, the former when the turbidity is fine, the latter when it is coarse. This the sun and the moon at their rising and setting, and also distant brightly illuminated mountain-tops, especially snow-mountains, appear coloured."" ""The high transparent landscapes of mountain regions, which so often lead the Alpine climber to under-estimate the distance and the magnitude of the mountain-tops before him, are also difficult to turn to account in a picturesque manner. Views from the valleys ... are far better; not only do they allow the various distances and magnitudes of what is seen to stand out, but they are on the other hand favourable to the artistic unity of colouration.""

Pasquale's Nose: Idle Days in an Italian Town,Uriel Dana,5,A Nose for Humor by Uriel Dana,"""The kind of book you want to read out loud to someone.... even the stranger sitting next to you!"" Uriel DanaHistory, eccentric characters & dry wit synergistically arrange themselves into laugh-out-loud combinations in Pasquale's Nose.In each chapter Rips demonstrates brilliant observational and storytelling abilities.By the end of the book, all of these surreal characters began to develop a larger, over-soul quality. They reminded me of cultures like the Aboriginal Australians that perceive realities on more than one level. The stories and the history of this place are not only extremely interesting and funny, but they left me pondering the possibilities for hours.",2023-01-01

Rockets and Missiles: The Life Story of a Technology (Greenwood Technographies),kclam,4,Good Read!,"This book offers a interesting overview of the history of rocket technology in the 20th century. Some technical details of the technology are also presented.Of particular interests are the vivid accounts of Apollo spacecraft, Space Shuttle, Intercontinental ballistic missiles, Submarine-launched ballistic missiles, Tactical guided Patriot missiles, Missile defense and Arms control.Missiles have evolved in the past decades and major changes have been made in their design. In contrast, improvements of the propulsion systems have been incremental only. However, the robot probe (Deep Space 1) was launched by an innovative propulsion system (a small ion engine) to study comet Borredly in 1998. This technology demonstrator may be evaluated for use on future spacecraft!",2023-01-01
Pasquale's Nose: Idle Days in an Italian Town,Beth Johnston,4,Immense Charm,"I enjoyed this book immensely. Michael Rips moves with his wife and daughter to Sutri, a town in Tuscany close to Rome, and discovers one of the oddest cast of characters imaginable. I suspect that Rips has a penchant for the odd and grotesque; still, I don't think he was inventing the aristocrat with a cat's paw for a hand, the old men with fond memories of POW camps in America, the restauranteur who refuses to serve dessert, or any of the other strange figures who populate this memoir of life in an Italian town. ...[The] book is a deeply welcome change from the ecstatic, sun-soaked memoirs typical of the genre. It also has a much more refined sense of history and sociology; Rips makes valient efforts to understand the unconventional mentality of the inhabitants of Sutri, all of whom attribute their marked clannishness to an Etruscan heritage (incorrectly, as it turns out.) This book was at once more realistic, and more fantastic than the average travelogue, almost like a fairy tale in the whimsicality of the stories it spun. My only quibble with the book is that Rips, a first-time author, didn't tell us enough about himself or what he was doing in Italy for me to really care about him or his family. The book has no sense of narrative; it's more a collection of sketches of his neighbors. I actually didn't realize Rips was an attorney until I read about it on Amazon; he portrays himself as a good-for-nothing layabout with no skills. A more honest account of himself, his family, and what they were doing in Sutri would have helped me better situate myself while reading this utterly engaging travel memoir. Still, this is one of the best examples of the genre I've read in a long time.",2023-01-01
Rockets and Missiles: The Life Story of a Technology (Greenwood Technographies),W Boudville,4,brief history,"In a concise manner, the author gives a history of rocketry and missiles. Starting with black powder used by the Chinese. But then rapidly the narrative passes to the Europeans, who used and improved it in their interminable wars. Naturally, most of the book is about the 20th century. Relating the advances made by both sides in World War 2.Then in the Cold War, rockets become exoatmospheric. Some were used for research, to carry satellites into orbit, or launch probes into high altitudes. But others were ICBMs. The book relates the frantic arms race between the US and Soviet Union, with Britain, France and China playing only bit parts.The space race is described, where we see the massive Saturn 5s that were used to launch moon missions.Unfortunately, if you read between the lines, progress in rocket propulsion has largely stalled. The end of the Cold War removed one major motivation. But also, the chemical and mechanical technologies appear to have plateaued, leaving us with still every high launch costs per kilo of payload.",2023-01-01
Pasquale's Nose: Idle Days in an Italian Town,Gary McIntyre,5,Thank god this is NOT Bella Tuscany!,"I picked this book up praying that it would not be about the exploits of some annoying North American couple who buy an old, decaying villa, purportedly of historic renown, and then hurriedly write a book to pay for their folly. I didn't want Bella Tuscany, I wanted Ugly Tuscany. Something with an edge, rough. Broken terra cotta. Dusty. Weathered. Parched. Pasquale's Nose is all that and more.In this case we get Ugly Tuscia, which rests near between Umbria and Tuscany. Michael Rips is not working and on his wife's suggestion they up and leave the United States for the lovely Italian hilltown of Sutria.He gives us just enough information about himself and why he's in Italy to keep you interested. His wife has coaxed him to go the Etruscan village of Sutria so that she can paint. They have brought their infant daughter with them.If you've been to any tiny little hill in the Tuscan area then this book will fill on the pieces you may have wanted to remember when you returned home but forgot.Rips recounts some of the history the town, which is wry and funny like most things in Italy. The local characters that he describes throughout the book are what I remember vividly-coarse, refined, and yet slightly tart. You'll find out who Pasquale really is, who the outcasts of the town are, and more dirt than Bella Tuscany was willing to reveal.Think of this book as `Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil' in Italy.",2023-01-01

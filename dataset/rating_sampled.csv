The Cultural Creatives: How 50 Million People Are Changing the World,"Jonathan G. Curtis ""game player and book reader""",4.0,becoming obvious,"If you dislike modern society, read this book to find out why.You'll also learn that there are millions who think similarly. You'll read about the three main segments of the population: Traditionals, Moderns, and Cultural Creatives.We all begin as Traditionals, grow up and become Moderns, and then mature to become Cultural Creatives. When we're Traditionals, we agree with whatever authority figures tell us. When we're Moderns, we agree with whatever society tells us. When we're Cultural Creatives, we rely on our conscience.American society went through these developmental stages in the 20th century. Americans began the 20th century as Traditionals. After two world wars, Americans became Moderns. The protest movement of the 1960's began the process of creating the Cultural Creatives.Most Americans remain Moderns, living their lives without concern for the global problems that their lifestyles contribute to. Some Americans remain Traditionals, believing most of what their religion and government tells them. A growing segment of Americans are Cultural Creatives, realizing that wasteful lifestyles contribute to global problems and corrective actions are needed.",2023-01-01
Short And Tall Tales: Moose County Legends (Cat Who Short Stories),Alan Mail,2.0,A minor companion,"Not as good as the &quot;Cat who...&quot; books themselves. Still, an easy read and not unenjoyable.",2023-01-01
"Living Simply with Children: A Voluntary Simplicity Guide for Moms, Dads, and Kids Who Want to Reclaim the Bliss of Childhood and the Joy of Parenting",C. B. Shaughnessy,5.0,Much needed breath of fresh air,"Thanks, Marie. What a wonderful book and gentle reminder of the most important things in life -- too many children are over consumers by the time they've even hit double digits. Your book is a welcome voice with helpful information for those of us interested in turning the tide against all of the consumer hype and the noise.",2023-01-01
One Skein: 30 Quick Projects to Knit or Crochet,"Barbie J. Lord ""ambrianmom""",5.0,book review,book of patterns using one skein or less. great gift idea that can be made quickly.,2023-01-01
One Skein: 30 Quick Projects to Knit or Crochet,Customer,3.0,"ok, not great","This is a great concept for a quit-knit, type of book, but I found some of the projects were a bit quirky; I don't know many people who use fingerless gloves or leg-warmers any more. Otherwise, this was a nice book, and perhaps something to keep yourself occupied with. I wouldn't really use this as a gift-giving resource.",2023-01-01
The Facts of Life: and Other Dirty Jokes,Tim Hitchner,2.0,For The Die-Hards Only,"The same basic material he has already covered in his autobiography ""WILLIE"" back in 1988, and the song lyrics have already been published in other retrospectives. An enjoyable must-have for Willie completists to be sure, but an otherwise repetitive, pointless book. And I am a big Willie Nelson fan.",2023-01-01
The Japanese Kitchen (Non),R. Hudson,5.0,Excellent class in a book!,"I purchased this book several years ago and cooked out of it almost exclusively for 6 months. It isn't like other cookbooks, this one is a class in a book. I read it from cover to cover and then taking it one section at a time tried the recipes following instructions carefully. In the process I learned more then I have from any cookbook with the exception of Sauces: Classical and Contemporary Sauce Making (James Peterson). Both come from an angle of teaching and both succeed magnificently. I would place this book on the same level as James Peterson's cookbooks as a result. My sushi rice was perfected and I learned an amazing pork sauce that my husband still raves about to this day. I even went out and bought her book ""The Sushi Experience"" sight unseen based solely on the quality of this book.So it is true this isn't like other cookbooks and it is organized very differently but if you really want to learn and not just have a list of recipes to follow blindly then this is the cookbook for you.",2023-01-01
One Skein: 30 Quick Projects to Knit or Crochet,"Tatya ""Wool Thumb""",1.0,Not really a one-skein project book,I bought this book whithout carefully looking inside and of course hoping to find some patterns for a single skein (everyone probably has a few single skeins of different pricey yarns they bought to try but couldn't afford more than that). I was so dissapointed! It seems that author doesn't really know what is average single skein is. One of the projects calls for 1250 yards skein of wool! That is very average skein size! Except for using single pattern for my own project I haven't knitted a single project out of that book. A lot of useless items and not enough of variety. Very dissapointed.,2023-01-01
The Cultural Creatives: How 50 Million People Are Changing the World,Chris,5.0,Awesome,Fantastic presentation of hope for the continuation of life on this planet. It is nice to know that the ones of us Paul Ray calls cultural creatives are not alone or few in number. Read this book to see how our world is changing and what is being done and can be done to sustain the planet and life on it.,2023-01-01
Soul Would Have No Rainbow if the Eyes Had No Tears and Other Native American Proverbs,Laura Linnell,5.0,Lots of Wisdom,"This is a wonderful compilation of wisdom from various Native Americans. Lots to ponder, lots to be awakened to, lots to agree with.",2023-01-01
Short And Tall Tales: Moose County Legends (Cat Who Short Stories),Valerie B. Anderson,5.0,Short and Tall Tales,"I like Ms Braun's work very much and would give each of her ""Cat Who"" books a five star. She is a wonderfu writer, who lets you see and feel her charactures and settings. I'm waiting for her next book.Sincerely,Valerie B. Anderson",2023-01-01
The Facts of Life: and Other Dirty Jokes,"Robert B. Makinson ""Robert B. Makinson""",3.0,Liked the lyrics,"Willie Nelson is a great singer. Now for the book: Most of the book consists of his song lyrics. That's the best part. As to the jokes, a few of them made me chuckle. The ""keep breathing"" and ""long liver"" lines on page 22 are ancient. Willie admits to being 68. As to the slang language, those same old ""s"" words and ""f"" words and a few others might be OK for emphasis, and if you like repetition, there's a bit of that.",2023-01-01
One Skein: 30 Quick Projects to Knit or Crochet,Emma,3.0,"Pretty good, but stretches the concept a little too much...","There are some really cute things in here, and I know I'll be knitting the cupcakes and some of the small bags. But I was a little annoyed by the inclusion of the tank top - sure, it only takes one skein - but it's a 1250 yard skein and the sizing only goes up to a 36-inch bust. Overall, though, pretty good and worth getting.",2023-01-01
The Facts of Life: and Other Dirty Jokes,"Kurt Harding ""bon vivant""",4.0,Peering Into The Mind Of A Legend,"I must be one of the few Texans who is not a huge Willie Nelson fan, yet there are times when I really enjoy listening to his songs. I always recognized that Nelson was a great songwriter, but I never thought of him before as an author.OK, it might not seem like its too difficult to write a book like this. Mix in some song lyrics, a few jokes, a few personal stories and blend in a few anecdotes and you've got a book. Nelson actually makes it a book worth reading as he shares his wit and observations on sundry topics with his fans. The words seemingly pour from his pen with aplomb as he writes in such a winning manner that the reader will not want to put the book down before finishing it.This is not great literature, but as you read and laugh along, you can't help but feel that you are peering into the mind of a legend.After reading it, I came away with a new appreciation of what Nelson is all about. If you like Willie on any level, you should enjoy reading it too.",2023-01-01
One Skein: 30 Quick Projects to Knit or Crochet,AALadd,3.0,A bit misleading,"I was so excited about this after all of the positive reviews. However, I was disappointed after getting it to see that many of the project do in fact require more than one skein (one skein of one color, one skein of a different color) or the skein are gigantic things that you would buy 3 balls of a normal yarn to substitute for. Some of that patterns are quite charming (the cupcakes) and others just things that I wouldn't normally use (like the armwarmers).",2023-01-01
The Cultural Creatives: How 50 Million People Are Changing the World,M. Wesley,3.0,There is better stuff out there...,"This work is hardly original. The material finds a much richer context and more nuanced analysis in Brief History of Everything (Ken Wiber)and in the work of Robert Kegan, Clare Graves, Susan Cook-Greuter and other developmentalists. The Cultural Creatives is essentially a popularization an sensationalization of this deeper developmental analysis by true scholars and is consequently shot through with the over-simplifications, hyperbole and blanket generalizations that characterize most works of this ilk. The books mentioned above show where the ""cultural creatives"" fit in the overall scheme of developmental research and they also reflect the developmental levels that emerge after those of cultural creatives.",2023-01-01
This Is Our Faith: A Catholic Catechism for Adults,"dlogos ""dlogos""",5.0,Complete introduction to the Catholic Faith,"For several years I have been using this book to supplement and reinforce the lessons in the RCIA (Rite of Christian Initiation for Adults) program. My students have found it very helpful. I think it does a wonderful job of providing the basic knowledge that every Catholic should know about their faith. While it is based on the much larger, more in depth and scholarly Catechism of the Catholic Church, this book makes the basic tenants of the faith understandable. Also included in the book is a good glossary of terms and several of the basic prayers most Catholics learn by heart. If you are interested in learning more about the faith regardless if you are a cradle Catholic, and want a better understanding, or are about to marry a Catholic and want to learn about your spouses faith, or are following the inner yearnings of the Spirit inside you, this book should prove to be a enlightening resource.",2023-01-01
The Japanese Kitchen (Non),maconr,4.0,Great for overall Japanese cooking techniques,This book is great for understanding the details involved with Japanese cooking. I would recomend this book to any cook.,2023-01-01
Blade Dancer,"beth ""egb63""",3.0,fun,"I stayed up way too late last night reading it. Very exciting -- and the fight scenes were really well done. I have no experience with fighting, but I could see the scenes. I really liked the character of Jory.However, I didn't like some things. My feelings for Kol - her partner...well I didn't have any. Parts of the book felt like a text adventure game. Also, I had to fight the urge to say &quot;Luke, I am your father&quot;.It was a fun romp. I hadn't read anything by Viehl before. I won't run right out and get another, but when I'm looking for another quick book to read, I'll try another.",2023-01-01
One Skein: 30 Quick Projects to Knit or Crochet,Joanna Daneman,5.0,One fun skein,"This book is a variant on the ""oddball"" idea. What do you do with one lone skein of yarn? You know the problem; you go to a knitting store and there is one simply cuddly, interesting, fascinating, pretty orphan ball of yarn (or it's leftover in your stash) and what on EARTH do you do with it? Here are some ideas.There is a very fine baby jacket made of one ball of each color to make a color block design (well, it isn't EXACTLY one skein, but sure uses up oddball colors.) But the real prize are the felted projects like felted small bags and felted bowls. These are great for gifts. There is also a novel boa made of pom-poms (leftovers really work here) and a couple of stylish mohair pillows with buttons. My absolute favorite, however, are the knitted cupcakes. Using a ribbing for the cupcake ""cup"" and frosting of furry novelty yarn, you can make a number of these intriguing non-edible confections, dress them up with bugle bead jimmies or a button cherry on top. A box of these would make a great gift and look really intriguing on a knick-knack shelf. Or just give them to the kids to play tea party. A lot of fun and could make a hilarious mom-child project or for a class art project. Terrific.",2023-01-01
The Cultural Creatives: How 50 Million People Are Changing the World,"Barbara Wright Abernathy ""Author of Venus On ...",4.0,Hope for a Brighter Future,"The Cultural Creatives describes the great social transformation that has already started and the people who are making it happen (a majority of whom are women, no surprise to me!) I'm definitely a CC. What is astonishing is that so many people share the new values and new way of life without realizing there are millions of others who are like us. This is a truly fascinating and enlightening study of American culture in the process of change.You will come away with hope for a brighter future as we cope with this difficult transition to a saner, wiser culture. We women must lead the way.",2023-01-01
The Facts of Life: and Other Dirty Jokes,Tom Bruce,2.0,"Willie can do no wrong, but this is close.","First, let me state emphatically that I am a huge Willie Nelson fan. He is, by far, my favorite recording artist and I have seen him in concert three times. That said, there is not much in this book to recommend it. There are a few very funny jokes, although not that dirty. There are dozens of simple, yet profound, song lyrics, mostly of his lesser known works. As a reader, I would have preferred to hear Willie sing them. Willie tells you he is in favor of the family farm, God, marijuana, less government. He is against smoking. He plays golf and jogs. Everybody seems to be his best friend. But, if you are a Willie fan, you already know that. And there's the problem. I didn't read anything about him I didn't already know. Damn, I wish he would really get serious about writing an autobiography. There is so much I would love to learn about Willie, but it's not here. Save your money and buy another Willie CD.",2023-01-01
This Is Our Faith: A Catholic Catechism for Adults,David M. Reed,1.0,This is Not Our Faith,"This is Our Faith by Michael Pennock which is based upon his earlier Seeker's Catechism which has received very poor reviews on Amazon is very, very weak and troubling. I would not recommend it to anyone serious about the Catholic faith. It is a very poor text, in many ways. They correlation between it and the CCC is very awkward at times, or other times, they just plain conflict. For example, the CCC states that the goal/objective of ecumenism is the reconciliation of all Christians to the Catholic Church. You will not find this anywhere in Pennock's book. In fact, Pennock, in contradiction to the CCC, states that the goal of ecumenism is: a common commitment among Christians to live out the gospel and to be open to the unifying action of the Holy Spirit."" Or, in violation of USCCB instruction regarding catechetical instruction, Pennock caveats nearly every statment of faith with: ""the Catholic church teaches""... or ""Catholics believe.."" lending the impression to the reader that there are other acceptable teachings that are just as valid as what ""the Catholic church teaches."" Most alarming, though, is his depiction of Christ. In the chapter ""Jesus: Lord and Messiah"", we are first told that Christ is compassionate, self-giving and humble, but Pennock doesn't get around to addressing his divinity until the last page and then only places it in a list of dogmas.Similarly, when answering the question ""What is meant by the 'real presence'?"", Pennock states that Jesus is present in the ""assembly"", the priest, and ""the word"", but he lists Christ's presence in the Eucharist - what the Catechism of the Catholic Church calls the ""source and summit of the Christian faith"" - last. Pennock, has such a lack of zeal for the Catholic faith, that by reading his ""catechism"" he nearly sucked out all the zeal I had inside of me. This primary texts gets two big thumbs down. How did this book ever get a imprimatur???",2023-01-01
The Penalty Box (New York Blades),TJ's Mommy,5.0,Yeah for the Underdog!,"I just had my ten year reunion, so I felt like I fit right into place with the characters in the book. And, I too, like Katie Fisher was a heavier girl in high school and have since lost the weight. I really enjoy reading books where I feel like I can jump into a character's shoes and feel right at home.Paul Van Dorn's character had bit parts in the novels previous to this. He was always a bit cocky and a show man, so to see him humbled by his hockey career ending early made for an interesting character in this book. Paul was the hockey jock in high school and one of the most popular guys around. So, it makes sense that he wouldn't have dated Katie Fisher. But, of course, 10 years can change things.It is a funny, romantic novel. Light hearted and fast paced. I really enjoy Deirdre Martin's books. This is a great story!",2023-01-01
One Skein: 30 Quick Projects to Knit or Crochet,Judi,4.0,misleading title for our crochet companions (& our one skein stashes!),"This book is great for the novice knitter looking to push themselves to learn new technique.I made the cupcakes as my first project on double pointed needles and first project that had actual finishing techniques, etc. It was challenging but well worth all of the effort once I saw the reaction on the recipient's face!I feel bad our crochet friends received a limited selection of patterns. I don't crochet, but even I know the purse patterns are basic shapes they don't need a pattern book for. And yes, the bathmat takes a cone of yarn, but the yardage is affordable when it's Pisgah's Peaches and Creme and not Rowan Cotton Rope like Tracey Ullman & Mel Clark used in Knit2Together. I don't understand that logic at all for something you step on and get dirty. Kudos to Leigh Radford for using affordable yarns.I gave this book 4 stars because even though most of the good patterns take up wayyy more than one skein, I *actually made* something from this book, and I'd make it again....and there are other things I'd make! Well, once I gather enough ""one skeins"" to make it-- Labyrinth rug, I'm looking at you!!",2023-01-01
